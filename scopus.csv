We performed bioinformatics analysis to identify key biomarkers associated with IA formation. Methods and results: We conducted a comprehensive analysis combined with multi-omics data and methods to identify immune-related genes (IRGs) and immunocytes involved in IAs. Functional enrichment analyses showed enhanced immune responses and suppressed organizations of extracellular matrix (ECM) during aneurysm progression. xCell analyses showed that the abundance of B cells, macrophages, mast cells, and monocytes significantly increased from levels in control to unruptured aneurysms and to ruptured aneurysms. Of 21 IRGs identified by overlapping, a three-gene (CXCR4, S100B, and OSM) model was constructed through LASSO logistic regression. The diagnostic ability of the three biomarkers in discriminating aneurysms from the control samples demonstrated a favorable diagnostic value. Among the three genes, OSM and CXCR4 were up-regulated and hypomethylated in IAs, while S100B was down-regulated and hypermethylated. The expression of the three IRGs was further validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry and mouse IA model using scRNA-seq analysis. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated heightened immune response and suppressed ECM organization in aneurysm formation and rupture. The three-gene immune-related signature (CCR4, S100B, and OSM) model may facilitate IA diagnosis and prevention. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bioinformatics; Immunity; Intracranial aneurysm; Methylation; WGCNA","Aneurysm, Ruptured; Animals; Biomarkers; Intracranial Aneurysm; Mice; Multiomics; chemokine receptor CXCR4; interleukin 17; messenger RNA; microRNA; protein S100B; biological marker; Article; B lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell infiltration; complement activation; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease exacerbation; extracellular matrix; gene expression; gene expression profiling; human; human tissue; humoral immunity; immune-related gene; immunocompetent cell; immunohistochemistry; intracranial aneurysm; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; lymphocyte; machine learning; macrophage; mast cell; memory T lymphocyte; monocyte; multiomics; NETosis; OSM gene; phagocytosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; single cell RNA seq; Th17 cell; unruptured intracranial aneurysm; upregulation; weighted gene co expression network analysis; aneurysm rupture; animal; genetics; intracranial aneurysm; mouse; multiomics","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Our approach consists of bringing together several learning methods namely supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning within the same Canvas. The objective is to choose among them the most optimal for classifying and predicting attacks while minimizing the impact linked to the learning costs of these attacks. In our proposed model, we have used a modular design to facilitate the implementation of the intrusion detection engine. The first Meta-learning module is used to collect metadata related to existing algorithmic parameters and learning methods in ML. As for the second module, it allows the use of a cost-sensitive learning technique so that the model is informed of the cost of intrusion detection scenarios. Therefore, among the ML classification algorithms, we choose the one whose automatic learning of intrusions is the least expensive in terms of its speed and its quality in predicting reality. This will make it possible to control the level of acceptable risk in relation to the typology of cyber-attacks. We then simulated our solution using the Weka tool. This led to questionable results, which can be subject to the evaluation of model performance. These results show that the classification quality rate is 93.66% and the classification consistency rate is 0.882 (close to unit 1).

However, direct analysis of EEG is highly challenging due to its nonlinear and nonstationary character. Various EEG rhythms provide a reliable method for the automatic recognition of emotions. Therefore, an integrated eigenvector centrality-variational nonlinear chirp mode decomposition-based EEG rhythm separation (EVNCERS) is developed. For selecting the dominant channels, the eigenvector centrality method (EVCM) is used followed by variational nonlinear chirp mode decomposition (VNCMD) to retrieve the instantaneous frequency (IF) and instantaneous amplitude (IA) from EEG signals. The equivalent IA and IF are used to create the delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms. The rhythms are analyzed over several entropy-based features, chosen using statistical analysis [mean and standard deviation (STD)], then categorized using various machine-learning methods. The proposed EVNCERS has achieved the highest performance of accuracy and F1-score for arousal: (96.86%, 97.98%), valence: (96.87%, 97.82%), and dominance: (96.81%, 97.71%) using random rotation forest classifier. The performance revealed that the delta rhythm offered more insight into automatic emotion recognition. The DREAMER dataset results demonstrate that our model has the highest predictive ability, with area-under-the-curve (AUC) values of 0.98 for arousal and dominance and 0.99 for the valence category. The SEED dataset also shows a similar trend, with the delta rhythm achieving the highest accuracy of 87.25% and F1-score of 74.54%. The proposed EVNCERS model can help in real-time situations to automatically recognize affective emotions, which would give us a greater range of emotional states.  © 2023 IEEE.","Affective emotion recognition; channel selection; eigenvector centrality method (EVCM); electroencephalography (EEG); machine learning (ML) models; rhythms separation; variational nonlinear chirp mode decomposition","Biomedical signal processing; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Emotion Recognition; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Nonlinear analysis; Speech recognition; Affective emotion recognition; Channel selection; Eigenvector centralities; Eigenvector centrality method; Emotion recognition; Linear chirp; Machine learning models; Mode decomposition; Non linear; Rhythm separation; Variational non-linear chirp mode decomposition; Mode decomposition","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

The objective of this study is to construct a predictive model comprising STMs and additional clinical characteristics, aiming to achieve precise prediction of EGFR mutations through noninvasive means. Materials and methods: We retrospectively collected 6711 NSCLC patients who underwent EGFR gene testing. Ultimately, 3221 stage IA patients and 1442 non-stage IA patients were analyzed to evaluate the potential predictive value of several clinical characteristics and STMs for EGFR mutations. Results: EGFR mutations were detected in 3866 patients (57.9 %) of all NSCLC patients. None of the STMs emerged as significant predictor for predicting EGFR mutations in stage IA patients. Patients with non-stage IA were divided into the study group (n = 1043) and validation group (n = 399). In the study group, univariate analysis revealed significant associations between EGFR mutations and the STMs (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC), and cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA21-1)). The nomogram incorporating CEA, CYFRA 21-1, pathology, gender, and smoking history for predicting EGFR mutations with non-stage IA was constructed using the results of multivariate analysis. The area under the curve (AUC = 0.780) and decision curve analysis demonstrated favorable predictive performance and clinical utility of nomogram. Additionally, the Random Forest model also demonstrated the highest average C-index of 0.793 among the eight machine learning algorithms, showcasing superior predictive efficiency. Conclusion: CYFRA21-1 and CEA have been identified as crucial factors for predicting EGFR mutations in non-stage IA NSCLC patients. The nomogram and 8 machine learning models that combined STMs with other clinical factors could effectively predict the probability of EGFR mutations. © 2024","Epidermal growth factor receptor; Lung cancer; Machine learning; Nomogram model; Serum tumor markers","","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Elucidating the interplay between DNA methylation and IA pathogenesis is paramount to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic interventions. Methods: We employed a comprehensive bioinformatics investigation of DNA methylation in IA, utilizing a transcriptomics-based methodology that encompassed 100 machine learning algorithms, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Mendelian randomization (MR), and summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR). Our sophisticated analytical strategy allowed for a systematic assessment of differentially methylated genes and their implications on the onset, progression, and rupture of IA. Results: We identified DNA methylation-related genes (MRGs) and associated molecular pathways, and the MR and SMR analyses provided evidence for potential causal links between the observed DNA methylation events and IA predisposition. Conclusion: These insights not only augment our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of IA but also underscore potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic avenues. Although our study faces inherent limitations and hurdles, it represents a groundbreaking initiative in deciphering the intricate relationship between genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors implicated in IA pathogenesis.

The study develops a machine learning and image processing algorithm-established automatic method for identifying asphalt pavement patches. The GrayLevel Co-Occurrence Matrix and image texture-based features derived from color channel statistics are used as input parameters to describe the condition of the pavement. For feature extraction, image processing methods like the projective integral of images, steerable filters, and an improved image thresholding method were used. Support Vector Machine is employed for categorizing the differentiating patched regions from non-patch ones. The suggested combination of image texture analytical methods has been trained using an IA data set created from 400 image samples. The feature set, which combines the characteristics of cracked objects with those generated from the projective integral, can produce the desired result. To make the model’s execution simpler, a patch recognition program was created and implemented in MATLAB. As a result, the recently created method has the potential to be an instrument for traffic management organizations through the assessment of pavement performance. The results of the experiments indicate that the newly developed method may achieve excellent accuracy prediction results with a classifier performance rate of about 96%. Such a method could enable transportation authorities to assess the state of asphalt pavement. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.","Asphalt pavement patch; Image processing; Machine learning; Statistical features; Support vector machine","Asphalt; Asphalt pavements; Image enhancement; Image texture; MATLAB; Textures; Asphalt pavement patch; Feature-based; Image features; Image processing algorithm; Images processing; Machine-learning; Pavement performance; Statistical features; Statistical properties; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Article","Article in press","Scopus"

Existing metrics, such as overall accuracy and F1-score, mainly concern the range and consistency of the semantic labels of image segments, which may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect missing or segmentation errors in small patches. To address this issue, this study proposes the investigator accuracy (IA) metric, which focuses on the location accuracy of single patches by evaluating the capture accuracy of their near-center subregions and category weight to determine the image segmentation quality. Before evaluating the IA metric, we optimize the grayscale dilation algorithm to separate each identified patch from the image without converting the data format and then distinguish each patch as embedded or nonembedded. Next, we use an iterative grayscale erosion approach to assess the distance-to-center weight, which is a crucial parameter for evaluating the IA of each pixel in a single patch. In addition, we apply a parallel analysis scheme to improve the efficiency of the IA evaluation. The results indicate that the capture accuracy of near-center subregions and the category weight of a single patch affect its IA. Unlike commonly used metrics, the IA is independent of the area ratio and the number of patches belonging to multiple landcover types. The output of the intermediate analysis steps can be used to produce thematic maps showing the distribution density of target patches. © 2023 The Authors","Accuracy evaluation; Digital image processing; Image segmentation; Location accuracy; Machine learning models","accuracy assessment; algorithm; classification; digital image; image processing; land cover; machine learning; pixel","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

This phenomenon leads to new political communication tactics, but also exposes citizens to potentially fraudulent, contaminated or pola-rised content. In this context, framed in post-truth, the term fake news gains relevance as a way of referring to disinformation and as a political and performative argument that can be weaponised. This research aims to analyse such use in the discourse of the former president Donald Trump during his presidential term (2017-2021), focussing on Twitter as the main platform in his political communication strategy online. To analyse this, we resort to a methodological triangulation of content, discourse, and sentiment analysis, with the latter combining both lexicon and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques through machine learning on the basis of deep learning and natural language processing, which is applied to his messages published with the term fake news (N = 768). The analysis of the sample, provided here in an open dataset, employs self-developed software that allows each unit of analysis to be filtered and coded around its predominant themes, sentiments, and words. The main results confirm that Trump’s attribution of fake news focusses on three main topics: the media (53%), politics (40%) and his cabinet (33%). It also shows how the former president resorts to a personalist agenda, focussed on the defence of his proposals and his team (80%) by delegitimizing his opponents and the press, with a negative tone (72%) loaded with derogatory terms, confirming a weaponised strategy of the term ‘fake news’ as a political argument of disinformation and disintermediation. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

Therefore, PM 2.5 , as the main pollutant, is an important research object of air pollution at present. Effectively improving the prediction accuracy of PM 2.5 volatility makes the PM 2.5 prediction content perfect, which is an important aspect of PM 2.5 concentration research. The volatility series has an inherent complex function law, which drives the volatility movement. When machine learning algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network) and SVM (Support Vector Machine) are used for volatility analysis, a high-order nonlinear form is used to fit the functional law of the volatility series, but the time-frequency information of the volatility has not been utilized. Based on EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) technique, GARCH (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model and machine learning algorithms, a new hybrid PM 2.5 volatility prediction model is proposed in this study. This model realizes time-frequency characteristic extraction of volatility series through EMD technology, and integrates residual and historical volatility information through GARCH model. The simulation results of the proposed model are verified by comparing the samples of 54 cities in North China with the benchmark models. The experimental results in Beijing showed that MAE (mean absolute deviation) of hybrid-LSTM decreased from 0.00875 to 0.00718 compared with LSTM, and hybrid-SVM based on the basic model SVM also significantly improved generalization ability, and its IA (index of agreement) improved from 0.846707 to 0.96595, showing the best performance. The experimental results show that the hybrid model is superior to other considered models in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, which verifies that the hybrid system modeling method is suitable for PM 2.5 volatility analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD); Hybrid volatility forecasting model; Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM); PM <sub>2.5</sub> volatility forecasting; Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Algorithms; Beijing; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Beijing [China]; China; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; decomposition analysis; forecasting method; machine learning; particulate matter; prediction; support vector machine; air pollutant; air pollution; algorithm; China; forecasting; human; machine learning","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

And as new surveys have been providing an immense amount of data on astronomical objects, the need to process such data automatically proves to be increasingly necessary. In this article, we use simulated data from the Dark Energy Survey, and from a pipeline originally created to classify supernovae, we developed a linear regression algorithm optimized through novel automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks achieving an error score better than ordinary data pre-processing methods when compared with other modern algorithms (such as XGBOOST). Numerically, the photometric prediction RMSE of type Ia supernovae events was reduced from 0.16 to 0.09 and the RMSE of all supernovae types decreased from 0.20 to 0.14. Our pipeline consists of four steps: through spectroscopic data points we interpolate the light curve using Gaussian process fitting algorithm, then using a wavelet transform we extract the most important features of such curves; in sequence we reduce the dimensionality of such features through principal component analysis, and in the end we applied super learning techniques (stacked ensemble methods) through an AutoML framework dedicated to optimize the parameters of several different machine learning models, better resolving the problem.

Methods: A cohort of 473 cases of lung adenocarcinomas from two hospitals was included, with 404 cases allocated to the training cohort and 69 cases to the testing cohort. Clinical characteristics and semantic features were collected, and radiomics features were extracted from the computed tomography (CT) images. Additionally, deep transfer learning (DTL) features were generated using RseNet50. Predictive models were developed using the logistic regression (LR) machine learning algorithm. Moreover, gene analysis was conducted on RNA sequencing data from 14 patients to explore the underlying biological basis of deep learning radiomics scores. Result: The training and testing cohorts achieved AUC values of 0.826 and 0.775 for the clinical model, 0.865 and 0.801 for the radiomics model, 0.927 and 0.885 for the DTL-radiomics model, and 0.928 and 0.898 for the nomogram model. The nomogram model demonstrated superiority over the clinical model. The decision curve analysis (DCA) revealed a net benefit in predicting OLNM for all models. The investigation into the biological basis of deep learning radiomics scores identified an association between high scores and pathways related to tumor proliferation and immune cell infiltration in the microenvironment. Conclusions: The nomogram model, incorporating clinical-semantic features, radiomics, and DTL features, exhibited promising performance in predicting OLNM. It has the potential to provide valuable information for non-invasive lymph node staging and individualized therapeutic approaches. © 2024","Deep learning; Lung adenocarcinoma; Occult lymph node metastasis; Radiomics","carcinoembryonic antigen; adult; area under the curve; Article; cancer staging; cell infiltration; chronic obstructive lung disease; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential gene expression; female; human; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; lung adenocarcinoma; lymph node metastasis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; microenvironment; middle aged; nomogram; radiomics; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; thorax radiography; tumor growth","Neoplasia Press, Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We developed and validated a novel biomarker with the aim of achieving broad clinical utility. The Xerna™ TME Panel is a pan-tumor, RNA expression-based classifier, designed to predict response to multiple tumor microenvironment (TME)-targeted therapies, including immunotherapies and anti-angiogenic agents. Methods: The Panel algorithm is an artificial neural network (ANN) trained with an input signature of 124 genes that was optimized across various solid tumors. From the 298-patient training data, the model learned to discriminate four TME subtypes: Angiogenic (A), Immune Active (IA), Immune Desert (ID), and Immune Suppressed (IS). The final classifier was evaluated in four independent clinical cohorts to test whether TME subtype could predict response to anti-angiogenic agents and immunotherapies across gastric, ovarian, and melanoma datasets. Results: The TME subtypes represent stromal phenotypes defined by angiogenesis and immune biological axes. The model yields clear boundaries between biomarker-positive and -negative and showed 1.6-to-7-fold enrichment of clinical benefit for multiple therapeutic hypotheses. The Panel performed better across all criteria compared to a null model for gastric and ovarian anti-angiogenic datasets. It also outperformed PD-L1 combined positive score (>1) in accuracy, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV), and microsatellite-instability high (MSI-H) in sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for the gastric immunotherapy cohort. Discussion: The TME Panel’s strong performance on diverse datasets suggests it may be amenable for use as a clinical diagnostic for varied cancer types and therapeutic modalities.

In this respect, sensorized insoles also have a great potential for extracting gait information. This, combined with mathematical techniques based on machine learning (ML), can potentialize biomechanical analyses. The present study proposes a proof-of-concept of a system based on vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) acquisition with a sensorized insole that uses an ML algorithm to identify different patterns of vGRF and extract biomechanical characteristics that can help during clinical evaluation. The acquired data from the system was clustered by an immunological algorithm (IA) based on vGRF during gait. These clusters underwent a data mining process using the classification and regression tree algorithm (CART), where the main characteristics of each group were extracted, and some rules for gait classification were created. As a result, the system proposed was able to collect and process the biomechanical behavior of gait. After the application of IA and CART algorithms, six groups were found. The characteristics of each of these groups were extracted and verified the capability of the system to collect and process the biomechanical behavior of gait, offering verification points that can help focus during a clinical evaluation. © 2022 by the authors.","biomechanics on gait; data mining; gait analysis; machine learning; smart insole","","MDPI","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

The biological events that underpin loss of immune tolerance and progression into inflammatory arthritis are not known. We sought to identify serum proteomic alterations that drive autoantibody formation, persistence and progression into inflammatory arthritis in a cohort of first-degree relatives (FDR) of RA patients. Methods: We studied baseline serum samples from a cohort of Indigenous FDR (n = 147) and quantified serum proteins using a 48-plex platform. Longitudinal outcomes were defined on the basis of ACPA status and progression into inflammatory arthritis (IA). K-means clustering, differential expression, and principal components analyze group differences. A co-expression module analysis was used to identify enriched networks. Random forest was used to classify ACPA positive samples, while network analysis was used to understand underlying biological processes based on protein expression. Results: We defined 6 proteomic clusters, with enrichment of ACPA positive samples in one of the clusters. 23 of 24 differentially expressed proteins in ACPA positive samples were upregulated. A co-expression network was enriched in ACPA positive sera and individuals who progressed into IA. Random Forest achieved an area under the curve of 0.767 to classify ACPA positive sera in a test dataset. Network analysis revealed upregulation of JAK-STAT signalling as being activated in those at highest risk to develop future IA. Conclusions: The serum proteome provides a rich dataset to understand biological processes in ACPA seropositive individuals. A combination of serum biomarkers, including ACPA, may predict future arthritis onset in at-risk individuals.

However, their implications in intracranial aneurysms (IAs) remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis could be identified as valuable starting points for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine for IAs. The transcriptional profiles of 75 IAs and 37 control samples were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs), weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were used to screen key genes. The ssGSEA algorithm was performed to establish phenotype scores. The correlation between mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis was evaluated using functional enrichment crossover, phenotype score correlation, immune infiltration, and interaction network construction. The IA diagnostic values of key genes were identified using machine learning. Finally, we performed the single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to explore mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis at the cellular level. In total, 42 IA-mitochondrial DEGs and 15 IA-necroptosis DEGs were identified. Screening revealed seven key genes invovled in mitochondrial dysfunction (KMO, HADH, BAX, AADAT, SDSL, PYCR1, and MAOA) and five genes involved in necroptosis (IL1B, CAMK2G, STAT1, NLRP3, and BAX). Machine learning confirmed the high diagnostic value of these key genes for IA. The IA samples showed higher expression of mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis exhibited a close association. Furthermore, scRNA-seq indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction and necroptosis were preferentially up-regulated in monocytes/macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within IA lesions. In conclusion, mitochondria-induced necroptosis was involved in IA formation, and was mainly up-regulated in monocytes/macrophages and VSMCs within IA lesions. Mitochondria-induced necroptosis may be a novel potential target for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of IA. © 2023, The Author(s).","3P medicine; Bioinformatics; Intracranialaneurysm; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Necroptosis","Apoptosis; bcl-2-Associated X Protein; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Necroptosis; Precision Medicine; 2 aminoadipate aminotransferase; amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; cryopyrin; interleukin 1beta; protein Bax; pyrroline 5 carboxylate reductase; STAT1 protein; protein Bax; Article; bioinformatics; clinical article; controlled study; diagnostic value; differential gene expression; gene expression; genetic transcription; human; human tissue; intracranial aneurysm; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; machine learning; macrophage; necroptosis; network analysis; personalized medicine; phenotype; signal transduction; single cell RNA seq; vascular smooth muscle cell; apoptosis; genetics; necroptosis","Springer","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Existing on-site earthquake early warning models focus on ground motion information and generally ignore the degree of structural response, with many machine learning models characterized by poor interpretability. Therefore, an on-site prediction model based on XGBoost with a continuous time window and multi-feature inputs is proposed. The model uses the response spectrum value, which is closely related to the structural response, as the predicted intensity measure and uses strong motion data from Japanese K-NET stations for training. After using permutation importance to eliminate irrelevant input feature parameters, 11 parameters (Pa, Pd Pav, Pad, IAV, IV2, Ia, TP, Fmax, TW, T) are determined as the final model input parameters. The results based on a test dataset show that 3 s after P-wave arrival, the mean square error of the model prediction is 15.10*10−4 g. As the input time window is extended, the mean square error of the model prediction gradually decreases, and the overestimation of small values is mitigated. Additionally, 10 s after P-wave arrival, the mean square error decreases by 7.66*10−4 g compared with that at 1 s. After using the PDP and SHAP methods to explain the model, T, Ia, and Fmax were determined as the feature parameters with the greatest impact on the model results. Generalization tests base on large seismic events not included in the training and test datasets indicated that the model has good generalization capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Earthquake early warning; Interpretable machine learning; Response spectrum; XGBoost","Continuous time systems; Errors; Forecasting; Large datasets; Machine learning; Seismic waves; Statistical tests; Earthquake early warning; Feature input; Interpretable machine learning; Machine-learning; Means square errors; Multifeatures; P-wave arrival; Response spectra; Structural response; Xgboost; acceleration; early warning system; machine learning; P-wave; prediction; response analysis; software; strong motion; structural response; Mean square error","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Methods: Twelve multi-institution datasets (837 cases of IA) were used to classify the high- and low-risk types (based on survival status within 5 years), and the biological differences were compared. Then, a gene-based classifying score (IA score) was trained, tested and validated by several machine learning methods. Furthermore, we estimated the significance of the IA score in the prognostic assessment, chemotherapy prediction and risk stratification of stage IA LUAD. We also developed an R package for the clinical application. The SEER database (15708 IA samples) and TCGA Pan-Cancer (1881 stage I samples) database were used to verify clinical significance. Results: Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group of stage IA LUAD has obvious enrichment of the malignant pathway and more driver mutations and copy number variations. The effect of the IA score on the classification of high- and low-risk stage IA LUAD was much better than that of classical clinicopathological factors (training set: AUC = 0.9, validation set: AUC = 0.7). The IA score can significantly predict the prognosis of stage IA LUAD and has a prognostic effect for stage I pancancer.

The present work develops a novel hybrid machine-learning model by combining singular value decomposition with kernel ridge regression (SKRR). In this context, a novel hybrid model known as H-SKRR is developed by combining two robust forecasting approaches, SKRR and ridge regression, which aims to improve multi-step-ahead predictions for weekly ILI rates in Southern and Northern China. The study begins with feature selection via XGBoost in the preprocessing phase, identifying optimal precursor information guided by importance factors. It decomposes the original signal using multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) to address non-stationarity and complexity. H-SKRR is implemented by incorporating significant lagged-time components across sub-components. The aggregated forecasted values from these sub-components generate ILI values for two horizons (i.e., 4-and 7-weekly ahead). Employing the gradient-based optimization (GBO) algorithm fine-tunes model parameters. Furthermore, the deep random vector functional link (dRVFL), Ridge regression, and gated recurrent unit neural network (GRU) models were employed to validate the MVMD-H-SKRR-GBO paradigm's effectiveness. The outcomes, assessed using the MARCOS (Measurement of alternatives and ranking according to compromise solution) method as a multi-criteria decision-making method, highlight the superior accuracy of the MVMD-H-SKRR-GBO model in predicting ILI rates. The results clearly highlight the exceptional performance of the MVMD-H-SKRR-GBO model, with outstanding precision demonstrated by impressive R, RMSE, IA, and U95 % values of 0.946, 0.388, 0.970, and 1.075, respectively, at t + 7. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","GBO algorithm; Influenza forecasting; Kernel ridge regression; MARCOS method; Multi-step ahead; Singular value decomposition (SVD)","Algorithms; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Influenza, Human; Neural Networks, Computer; Public Health; Decision making; Forecasting; Recurrent neural networks; Regression analysis; Singular value decomposition; Gradient based optimization algorithms; Gradient-based optimization; Influenza forecasting; Kernel ridge regressions; Measurement of alternative and ranking according to compromize solution method; Measurements of; Multi-step ahead; Multisteps; Singular value decomposition; Solution methods; algorithm; Article; clinical assessment; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; decomposition; deep random vector functional link; feature selection; flu like syndrome; forecasting; gated recurrent unit network; genetic algorithm; gradient based optimization; Hilbert transform; human; influenza; information processing; intrinsic mode function; kernel method; machine learning; mathematical analysis; measurement of alternative and ranking according to compromise solution; multicriteria decision analysis; multivariate variational mode decomposition; outcome assessment; regression analysis; ridge regression; singular value decomposition; singular value decomposition with kernel ridge regression; artificial neural network; epidemic; influenza; public health; Variational mode decomposition","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, the current limited knowledge of alterations in the immune microenvironment of IA has hampered the mastery of pathological mechanisms and technological advances, such as molecular diagnostic and coated stent-based molecular therapy. In this study, seven IA datasets were enrolled from the GEO database to decode the immune microenvironment and relevant biometric alterations. The ssGSEA algorithm was employed for immune infiltration assessment. IAs displayed abundant immune cell infiltration, activated immune-related pathways, and high expression of immune-related genes. Several immunosuppression cells and genes were also coordinately upregulated in IAs. Five immune-related hub genes, including CXCL10, IL6, IL10, STAT1, and VEGFA, were identified from the protein-protein interaction network and further detected at the protein level. CeRNA networks and latent drugs targeting the hub genes were predicted for targeted therapy reference. Two gene modules recognized via WCGNA were functionally associated with contractile smooth muscle loss and extracellular matrix metabolism, respectively. In blood datasets, a pathological feature-derived gene signature (PFDGS) for IA diagnosis and rupture risk prediction was established using machine learning. Patients with high PFDGS scores may possess adverse biological alterations and present with a high risk of morbidity or IA rupture, requiring more vigilance or prompt intervention. Overall, we systematically unveiled an “immuno-thermal” microenvironment characterized by co-enhanced immune activation and immunosuppression in IA, which provides a novel insight into molecular pathology. The PFDGS is a promising signature for optimizing risk surveillance and clinical decision-making in IA patients.

Based on a field study at an AI company, this article studies how AI is performed as developers enact two predictive systems along with stakeholders in public sector accounting and public sector healthcare. Inspired by STS theories about values in design, we analyze our empirical data focusing especially on how objectives, structured performances, and divisions of labor are built into the two systems and at whose expense. Our findings reveal that the development of the two AI systems is informed by politically motivated managerial interests in cost-efficiency. This results in AI systems that are (1) designed as managerial tools meant to enable efficiency improvements and cost reductions, and (2) enforced on professionals on the ‘shop floor’ in a top-down manner. Based on our findings and a discussion drawing on literature on the original visions of human-centered systems design from the 1960s, we argue that turning AI into IA seems dubious, and ask what human-centered AI really means and whether it remains an ideal not easily realizable in practice. More work should be done to rethink human-machine relationships in the age of big data and AI, in this way making the call for ethical and responsible AI more genuine and trustworthy. © The Author(s) 2023.","artificial intelligence; computer systems design; human-centered systems; intelligence augmentation; machine learning; responsible AI","Humans; Policy; Public Sector; human; policy; public sector","SAGE Publications Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Air quality measurements were initiated in different backgrounds including urban, suburban, industrial and rural to detect any significant changes in air quality parameters. Due to the dynamic nature of the weather, geographical location and anthropogenic sources, many uncertainties must be considered when dealing with air pollution data. In recent years, the Bayesian approach to fitting statistical models has gained more popularity due to its alternative modelling strategy that accounted for uncertainties for all air quality parameters. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the performance of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) in predicting the next-day PM10 concentration in Peninsular Malaysia. A case study utilized seventeen years’ worth of air quality monitoring data from nine (9) monitoring stations located in Peninsular Malaysia, using eight air quality parameters, i.e., PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, temperature, relative humidity and wind speed. The performances of the next-day PM10 prediction were calculated using five models’ performance evaluators, namely Coefficient of Determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IA), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The BMA models indicate that relative humidity, wind speed and PM10 contributed the most to the prediction model for the majority of stations with (R2 = 0.752 at Pasir Gudang monitoring station), (R2 = 0.749 at Larkin monitoring station), (R2 = 0.703 at Kota Bharu monitoring station), (R2 = 0.696 at Kangar monitoring station) and (R2 = 0.692 at Jerantut monitoring station), respectively. Furthermore, the BMA models demonstrated a good prediction model performance, with IA ranging from 0.84 to 0.91, R2 ranging from 0.64 to 0.75 and KGE ranging from 0.61 to 0.74 for all monitoring stations. According to the results of the investigation, BMA should be utilised in research and forecasting operations pertaining to environmental issues such as air pollution. From this study, BMA is recommended as one of the prediction tools for forecasting air pollution concentration, especially particulate matter level. © 2023 by the authors.","air quality; air quality modeling; Bayesian; machine learning; particulate matter; prediction","Malaysia; West Malaysia; Air quality; Errors; Forecasting; Mean square error; Particles (particulate matter); Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Wind speed; Air quality models; Air quality parameters; Bayesian; Bayesian model averaging; Machine-learning; Malaysia; Monitoring stations; Particulate Matter; Performance; PM 10; air quality; atmospheric modeling; Bayesian analysis; concentration (composition); machine learning; particulate matter; performance assessment; prediction; Machine learning","MDPI","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

The aim of this study is to determine the best machine learning algorithm for radiomics modeling and to compare the performances of the radiomics model, the clinical-radilogical model and the combined model incorporate both radiomics features and clinical-radilogical features in preoperatively predicting ONM in clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma patients. Methods: Patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma undergoing curative surgery from one institution were retrospectively recruited and assigned to training and test cohorts. Radiomics features were extracted from the preoperative computed tomography (CT) images of the primary tumor. Seven machine learning algorithms were used to construct radiomics models, and the model with the best performance, evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), was selected. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed on the clinical-radiological features to identify statistically significant features and to develop a clinical model. The optimal radiomics and clinical models were integrated to build a combined model, and its predictive performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: This study included 258 patients who underwent resection (training cohort, n=182; test cohort, n=76). Six radiomics features were identified. Among the seven machine learning algorithms, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) demonstrated the highest performance for radiomics modeling, with an AUC of 0.917. The combined model improved the AUC to 0.933 and achieved a Brier score of 0.092. DCA revealed that the combined model had optimal clinical efficacy. Conclusions: The superior performance of the combined model, based on XGB algorithm in predicting ONM in patients with clinical stage IA lung adenocarcinoma, might aid surgeons in deciding whether to conduct mediastinal LN dissection and contribute to improve patients’ prognosis. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

In order to systematically investigate the influence law of different parameters on lateral displacement, this paper establishes a numerical model of the seismic responses of gently sloping grounds through the open-source finite element software OpenSees and carries out a large number of calculations considering various working conditions. Based on the calculation results, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) regression are used to build the proxy models for lateral spread displacement prediction. The finite element model was verified by using the multiple VELACS No. 2 centrifuge experiments. Finally, the model was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method. The results of the model training showed that both models were able to achieve a good fit to the numerical calculation results, with the RF model having a smaller prediction error for the centrifuge experiments. The model interpretation results showed that the modified cumulative absolute velocity (CAV5) was the most important input variable in the model, and the importance of ground slope (S), relative density (Dr) and thickness of liquefiable soil layer (HL) was relatively high. In addition, the influence of each parameter on the lateral displacement is consistent with the actual situation, reflecting the rationality of the model prediction process. In addition, the results showed that there is a threshold for the modified cumulative absolute velocity (CAV5) and Arias intensity (Ia) that leads to a significant increase in lateral displacement. The thresholds of CAV5 and Ia are 1.3 g s and 1.0 m/s, respectively. These thresholds are in good agreement with the thresholds for triggering the overall initial liquefaction of the soil layer determined by related studies, which provides a reference for the evaluation of liquefaction-induced lateral displacement. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","liquefaction-induced lateral spread; machine learning; OpenSees; Shapley additive explanation method","","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","English","Article","Article in press","Scopus"

Rough surfaces containing scratches, plastic deformation streaks, micro cracks and pitting were observed. According to the Taguchi method, the same optimum sandblasting parametric setting maximized SR and MC but failed to maximize SS. Subsequently, the principal component analysis embedded in statistical machine learning was applied to find the optimum sandblasting parametric setting that maximized all the performance characteristics. The optimum sandblasting setting of IA = 45°, AP = 110 μm, ST = 20 s and P = 400 kPa predicted the maximum values of SR = 0.773 μm, MC = 36% and SS = 16.6 MPa. Analysis of variance confirmed AP and P as the most influencing parameters affecting all performance characteristics. Finally, these results provide a systematic and comprehensive route for optimizing sandblasting roughening of YTZP surfaces which can be adopted in adhesive dental and orthodontic industry. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Phase transformation; Sandblasting process parameters; Shear bond strength; Statistical machine learning; Surface roughness; Taguchi method; YTZP","Dental Bonding; Materials Testing; Resin Cements; Shear Strength; Surface Properties; Yttrium; Zirconium; Adhesives; Bond strength (materials); Ductile fracture; Machine learning; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Phase transitions; Principal component analysis; Taguchi methods; Yttrium oxide; Zirconia; monomer; plastic; resin cement; yttria; yttrium; zirconium; zirconium oxide; Abrasive particle size; Performance characteristics; Phases transformation; Process parameters; Sandblasting process parameter; Shear bond strengths; Statistical machine learning; Taguchi's methods; Tetragonal zirconia polycrystal; Yttria tetragonal zirconium polycrystal; Article; calculation; crystal; experimental design; machine learning; orthodontics; particle size; physical parameters; polymerization; principal component analysis; procedures; process technology; sandblasting process; scanning electron microscopy; shear bond strength; shear strength; statistical parameters; surface property; taguchi method; wettability; X ray diffraction; yttria tetragonal zirconia polycrystal; chemistry; dental bonding; materials testing; shear strength; surface property; Surface roughness","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

This system captures and processes HS images at 14 frames per second (FPS) during the course of a tumor resection operation to detect and delimit cancer tissue at the same time the neurosurgeon operates. The result is represented in an AR visualization where the classification results are overlapped with the RGB point cloud captured by a LiDAR camera. This representation allows natural navigation of the scene at the same time it is captured and processed, improving the visualization and hence effectiveness of the HS technology to delimit tumors.

Methods: The clinical, pathological, and HRCT imaging data of 457 patients (from bicentric) with pathologically confirmed stage IA IAC (459 lesions in total) were retrospectively analyzed. The 459 lesions were classified into high-grade pattern (HGP) (n = 101) and non-high-grade pattern (n-HGP) (n = 358) groups depending on the presence of HGP (micropapillary and solid) in pathological results. The clinical and pathological data contained age, gender, smoking history, tumor stage, pathological type, and presence or absence of tumor spread through air spaces (STAS). CT features consisted of lesion location, size, density, shape, spiculation, lobulation, vacuole, air bronchogram, and pleural indentation. The independent predictors for HGP were screened by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The clinical, CT, and clinical-CT models were constructed according to the multivariable analysis results. Results: The multivariate analysis suggested the independent predictors of HGP, encompassing tumor size (p = 0.001; OR = 1.090, 95% CI 1.035–1.148), density (p < 0.001; OR = 9.454, 95% CI 4.911–18.199), and lobulation (p = 0.002; OR = 2.722, 95% CI 1.438–5.154). The AUC values of clinical, CT, and clinical-CT models for predicting HGP were 0.641 (95% CI 0.583–0.699) (sensitivity = 69.3%, specificity = 79.2%), 0.851 (95% CI 0.806–0.896) (sensitivity = 79.2%, specificity = 79.6%), and 0.852 (95% CI 0.808–0.896) (sensitivity = 74.3%, specificity = 85.8%).

Methods: A total of 421 patients with histopathologically proved EC (101 recurrence vs. 320 non-recurrence EC) from four medical centers were included in this retrospective study, and were divided into the training (n = 235), internal validation (n = 102), and external validation (n = 84) cohorts. In total, 1702 radiomics features were respectively extracted from areas with different extensions for each patient. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier was applied to establish the clinicopathological model (CM), radiomics model (RM), and fusion model (FM). The performance of the established models was assessed by the discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted to further determine the prognostic value of the models by evaluating the differences in recurrence-free survival (RFS) between the high- and low-risk patients of recurrence. Results: The FMs showed better performance compared with the models based on clinicopathological or radiomics features alone but with a reduced tendency when the peritumoral area (PA) was extended. The FM based on intratumoral area (IA) [FM (IA)] had the optimal performance in predicting the recurrence risk in terms of the ROC, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that high-risk patients of recurrence defined by FM (IA) had a worse RFS than low-risk ones of recurrence. Conclusions: The FM integrating intratumoral radiomics features and clinicopathological factors could be a valuable predictor for the recurrence risk of EC patients. Clinical relevance statement: An accurate prediction based on our developed FM (IA) for the recurrence risk of EC could facilitate making an individualized therapeutic decision and help avoid under- or over-treatment, therefore improving the prognosis of patients. Key Points: • The fusion model combined clinicopathological factors and radiomics features exhibits the highest performance compared with the clinicopathological model and radiomics model. • Although higher values of area under the curve were observed for all fusion models, the performance tended to decrease with the extension of the peritumoral region. • Identifying patients with different risks of recurrence, the developed models can be used to facilitate individualized management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Society of Radiology.","Disease management; Endometrial neoplasms; Machine learning; Magnetic resonance imaging; Recurrence","analysis of variance; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; classifier; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross validation; diagnostic test accuracy study; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; endometrium cancer; feature extraction; feature selection; female; high risk patient; human; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; low risk patient; machine learning; major clinical study; measurement repeatability; prediction; preoperative evaluation; prognostic assessment; radiomics; recurrence free survival; recurrence risk; retrospective study; survival analysis; T1 weighted imaging; T2 weighted imaging; validation study","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Its role in immunity is still emerging. However, the involvement of ICD in Intracranial Aneurysms (IA) remains unclear. This study aimed to identify biomarkers associated with ICDs and determine the relationship between them and the immune microenvironment during the onset and progression of IA Methods: The IA gene expression profiles were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IA were identified and the effects of the ICD on immune microenvironment signatures were studied. Techniques like Lasso, Bayes, DT, FDA, GBM, NNET, RG, SVM, LR, and multivariate analysis were used to identify the ICD gene signatures in IA. A consensus clustering algorithm was used for conducting the unsupervised cluster analysis of the ICD patterns in IA. Furthermore, enrichment analysis was carried out for investigating the various immune responses and other functional pathways. Along with functional annotation, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module construction, identification of the hub gene, and co-expression analysis were also carried out. Results: The above techniques were used for establishing the ICD gene signatures of HMGB1, HMGN1, IL33, BCL2, HSPA4, PANX1, TLR9, CLEC7A, and NLRP3 that could easily distinguish IA from normal samples. The unsupervised cluster analysis helped in identifying three ICD gene patterns in different datasets. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that the IA samples showed many differences in pathways such as the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, chemokine signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, viral protein interaction with the cytokines and cytokine receptors, and a few other signaling pathways compared to normal samples. In addition, the three ICD modification modes showed obvious differences in their immune microenvironment and the biological function pathways. Eight ICD-regulators were identified and showed meaningful associations with IA, suggesting they could severe as potential prognostic biomarkers. Conclusions: A new gene signature for IA based on ICD features was created. This signature shows that the ICD pattern and the immune microenvironment are closely related to IA and provide a basis for optimizing risk monitoring, clinical decision-making, and developing novel treatment strategies for patients with IA.

Ground-glass opacity (GGO) is considered the appearance of early lung cancer, and there remains an unmet clinical need to understand the pathology of small GGO (<1 cm in diameter). The objective of this study was to use the transcriptome profiling of pGGO specimens <1 cm in diameter to construct a pGGO-related gene risk signature to predict the prognosis of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and explore the immune microenvironment of GGO. pGGO-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened to identify prognostic marker genes with two machine learning algorithms. A 15-gene risk signature was constructed from the DEGs that were shared between the algorithms. Risk scores were calculated using the regression coefficients for the pGGO-related DEGs. Patients with Stage I/II LUAD or Stage IA LUAD and high-risk scores had a worse prognosis than patients with low-risk scores. The prognosis of high-risk patients with Stage IA LUAD was almost identical to that of patients with Stage II LUAD, suggesting that treatment strategies for patients with Stage II LUAD may be beneficial in high-risk patients with Stage IA LUAD. pGGO-related DEGs were mainly enriched in immune-related pathways. Patients with high-risk scores and high tumor mutation burden had a worse prognosis and may benefit from immunotherapy. A nomogram was constructed to facilitate the clinical application of the 15-gene risk signature. Receiver operating characteristic curves and decision curve analysis validated the predictive ability of the nomogram in patients with Stage I LUAD in the TCGA-LUAD cohort and GEO datasets.

Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) which is used as a proxy for estimating the algal concentration, is affected by a wide range of weather and physicochemical factors that act at varying spatial and temporal scales. Deep learning (DL) based models such as Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results for hydrological and Chl-a simulations. Recently several variants of LSTM and CNNs have been developed which can model highly non-linear relationships between input and target data. Therefore, these advanced DL methods have the potential for long-term simulation of Chl-a. Previous DL-based studies on Chl-a simulation have developed site-dependent models. This indicates that the DL models were trained and evaluated using data from the same site, making it difficult to apply these models to other sites. Development of site-independent models requires a more robust training strategy which can result in DL models that can be evaluated in new novel situations. To address these issues, we propose a DL-based framework which can incorporate irregularly measured water quality observations, static physical features, and climate data measured at constant time steps. In this framework, we compared the performance of six state of the art DL methods which include (1) LSTM, (2) CNN, (3) Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN), (4) CNN-LSTM, (5) LSTM based autoencoder, and (6) input-attention LSTM (IA-LSTM). The IA-LSTM is an explainable DL method which can select important hydrologic, climatic and water quality parameters for Chl-a prediction. Our results indicate that the IA-LSTM exhibited the best performance, with an R2 value of 0.85 at the training site and 0.52 at the test site. We showed that attention-based deep learning models improve the prediction performance and make the black-box deep learning models interpretable and explainable. The attention-based deep learning models indicated that Chl-a concentration in the Nakdong River was strongly affected by climate factors during the previous three days. The proposed DL framework can be adopted to develop regional water quality models using deep learning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Chlorophyll-a; Deep learning; Explainable-AI; Machine learning","Nakdong River; South Korea; Catchments; Chlorophyll; Climate models; Convolution; Forecasting; Learning systems; Surface waters; Water quality; Chlorophyll a; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Explainable-AI; Learning methods; Learning models; Learning-based algorithms; Long-term prediction; Machine-learning; Performance; algal bloom; algorithm; artificial neural network; catchment; chlorophyll a; machine learning; surface water; water quality; Long short-term memory","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We aim to develop the noninvasive pathology and grade evaluation approach for patients with stage IA LUAD via CT-based radiomics approach and evaluate their performance in clinical practice. Methods: Chest CT scans were retrospectively collected from patients who were diagnosed with stage IA LUAD and underwent complete resection at two hospitals. A deep learning segmentation algorithm was first applied to assist lesion delineation. Expansion strategies such as bounding-box annotations were further applied. Radiomics features were then extracted and selected followed by radiomics modeling based on four classic machine learning algorithms for histologic subtype classification and grade stratification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate model performance. Results: The study included 294 and 145 patients with stage IA LUAD from two hospitals for radiomics analysis, respectively.

Bounding-box annotation strategy also enabled MLP an acceptable and stable accuracy among test sets. Meanwhile, logistic regression was selected for grade stratification and achieved the average AUC of 0.928, 0.837, and 0.748 on internal, independent, and external test sets with optimal annotation strategies. Conclusions: DL-enhanced radiomics models had great potential to predict the fine histological subtypes and grades of early-stage LUADs based on CT images, which might serve as a promising noninvasive approach for the diagnosis and management of early LUADs.

We present a U-Net-based deep learning (DL) model to automatically label detailed anatomical segments in computed tomography angiography (CTA) for the first time. The trained DL algorithm was further tested on a clinically relevant set for the localization of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Methods: 457 examinations with varying degrees of arterial stenosis were used to train, validate, and test the model, aiming to automatically label 42 segments of the intracranial arteries [e.g., 7 segments of the internal carotid artery (ICA)]. Evaluation metrics included Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and Hausdorff distance (HD). Additionally, 96 examinations containing at least one IA were enrolled to assess the model’s potential in enhancing clinicians’ precision in IA localization. A total of 5 clinicians with different experience levels participated as readers in the clinical experiment and identified the precise location of IA without and with algorithm assistance, where there was a washout period of 14 days between two interpretations. The diagnostic accuracy, time, and mean interrater agreement (Fleiss’ Kappa) were calculated to assess the differences in clinical performance of clinicians. Results: The proposed model exhibited notable labeling performance on 42 segments that included 7 anatomical segments of ICA, with the mean DSC of 0.88, MSD of 0.82 mm and HD of 6.59 mm. Furthermore, the model demonstrated superior labeling performance in healthy subjects compared to patients with stenosis (DSC: 0.91 vs. 0.89, p < 0.05; HD: 4.75 vs. 6.19, p < 0.05). Concurrently, clinicians with model predictions achieved significant improvements when interpreting the precise location of IA. The clinicians’ mean accuracy increased by 0.04 (p = 0.003), mean time to diagnosis reduced by 9.76 s (p < 0.001), and mean interrater agreement (Fleiss’ Kappa) increased by 0.07 (p = 0.029). Conclusion: Our model stands proficient for labeling intracranial arteries using the largest CTA dataset. Crucially, it demonstrates clinical utility, helping prioritize the patients with high risks and ease clinical workload.

Urgent evaluation and diagnosis is important as treating TIA early can prevent subsequent strokes. Recent improvements in mass spectrometer technology allow quantification of hundreds of plasma proteins and lipids, yielding large datasets that would benefit from different approaches including machine learning. Using plasma protein, lipid and radiological biomarkers, our study will develop predictive algorithms to distinguish TIA from minor stroke (positive control) and TIA-mimics (negative control). Analysis including machine learning employs more sophisticated modelling, allowing non-linear interactions, adapting to datasets and enabling development of multiple specialised test-panels for identification and differentiation. Methods and analysis Patients attending the Emergency Department, Stroke Ward or TIA Clinic at the Royal Adelaide Hospital with TIA, minor stroke or TIA-like symptoms will be recruited consecutively by staff-alert for this prospective cohort study. Advanced neuroimaging will be performed for each participant, with images assessed independently by up to three expert neurologists. Venous blood samples will be collected within 48 hours of symptom onset. Plasma proteomic and lipid analysis will use advanced mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis will be performed using MS software. Output files will be analysed for relative biomarker quantitative differences between the three groups. Differences will be assessed by linear regression, one-way analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis H-test, χ 2 test or Fisher's exact test. Machine learning methods will also be applied including deep learning using neural networks.

Neither method allows for the intuitive exploration of differing trade-off options during calibration, which may aid in ensuring automated solutions align with clinical preference. Pareto navigation provides this functionality and offers a potential calibration alternative. The purpose of this study was to validate an automated radiotherapy planning solution with a novel multi-dimensional Pareto navigation calibration interface across two external institutions for prostate cancer. Methods: The implemented ‘Pareto Guided Automated Planning’ (PGAP) methodology was developed in RayStation using scripting and consisted of a Pareto navigation calibration interface built upon a ‘Protocol Based Automatic Iterative Optimisation’ planning framework. 30 previous patients were randomly selected by each institution (IA and IB), 10 for calibration and 20 for validation. Utilising the Pareto navigation interface automated protocols were calibrated to the institutions’ clinical preferences. A single automated plan (VMATAuto) was generated for each validation patient with plan quality compared against the previously treated clinical plan (VMATClinical) both quantitatively, using a range of DVH metrics, and qualitatively through blind review at the external institution. Results: PGAP led to marked improvements across the majority of rectal dose metrics, with Dmean reduced by 3.7 Gy and 1.8 Gy for IA and IB respectively (p < 0.001). For bladder, results were mixed with low and intermediate dose metrics reduced for IB but increased for IA. Differences, whilst statistically significant (p < 0.05) were small and not considered clinically relevant. The reduction in rectum dose was not at the expense of PTV coverage (D98% was generally improved with VMATAuto), but was somewhat detrimental to PTV conformality. The prioritisation of rectum over conformality was however aligned with preferences expressed during calibration and was a key driver in both institutions demonstrating a clear preference towards VMATAuto, with 31/40 considered superior to VMATClinical upon blind review. Conclusions: PGAP enabled intuitive adaptation of automated protocols to an institution’s planning aims and yielded plans more congruent with the institution’s clinical preference than the locally produced manual clinical plans. © The Author(s) 2024.","AI; Automation; IMRT; MCO; Multi-institutional; Pareto; Prostate cancer; Radiotherapy; Treatment planning; VMAT","Humans; Male; Organs at Risk; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Urinary Bladder; Article; automation; calibration; cancer radiotherapy; clinical practice; clinical protocol; cohort analysis; evaluation study; health care utilization; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; machine learning; major clinical study; male; Pareto navigation; planning target volume; prostate cancer; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; radiation dose; rectum; statistical significance; treatment planning; validation process; volumetric modulated arc therapy; bladder; clinical trial; intensity modulated radiation therapy; multicenter study; organs at risk; procedures; prostate tumor; radiotherapy dosage","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We sought to develop and evaluate a quantitative imaging method to determine invasiveness of small, ground-glass lesions on computed tomography (CT) chest scans. Methods: The study comprised 268 patients from 4 institutions with resected (<=3 cm) semisolid lesions with confirmed histopathological diagnosis of MIA/AIS or INV. A total of 248 radiomic texture features from within the tumor nodule (intratumoral) and adjacent to the nodule (peritumoral) were extracted from manually annotated lung nodules of chest CT scans. The datasets were randomly divided, with 40% of patients used for training and 60% used for testing the machine classifier (Training DTrain, N=106; Testing, DTest, N=162). Results: The top five radiomic stable features included four intratumoral (Laws and Haralick feature families) and one peritumoral feature within 3 to 6 mm of the nodule (CoLlAGe feature family), which successfully differentiated INV from MIA/AIS nodules with an AUC of 0.917 [0.867-0.967] on DTrain and 0.863 [0.79-0.931] on DTest. The radiomics model successfully differentiated INV from MIA cases (<1 cm AUC: 0.76 [0.53-0.98], 1-2 cm AUC: 0.92 [0.85-0.98], 2-3 cm AUC: 0.95 [0.88-1]). The final integrated model combining the classifier with the radiologists’ score gave the best AUC on DTest (AUC=0.909, p<0.001). Conclusions: Addition of advanced image analysis via radiomics to the routine visual assessment of CT scans help better differentiate adenocarcinoma subtypes and can aid in clinical decision making. Further prospective validation in this direction is warranted.

This study applied a dual-staged attention mechanism based on long short-term memory network (DA-LSTM) to improve the accuracy of effluent quality prediction. The results showed that input attention (IA) and temporal attention (TA) significantly enhanced the prediction performance of LSTM. Specially, IA could adaptively adjust feature weights to enhance the robustness against input noise, with R2 increased by 13.18%. To promote its long-term memory ability, TA was used to increase the memory span from 96 h to 168 h. Compared to a single LSTM model, the DA-LSTM model showed an improvement in prediction accuracy by 5.10%, 2.11%, 14.47% for COD, TP, and TN. Additionally, DA-LSTM demonstrated excellent generalization performance in new scenarios, with the R2 values for COD, TP, and TN increasing by 22.67%, 20.06%, and 17.14% respectively, while the MAPE values decreased by 56.46%, 63.08%, and 42.79%. In conclusion, the DA-LSTM model demonstrated excellent prediction performance and generalization ability due to its advantages of feature-adaptive weighting and long-term memory focusing. This has forward-looking significance for achieving efficient early warning of abnormal operating conditions and timely management of control parameters. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Deep learning; Dual-stage attention-based LSTM; Effluent quality prediction; Multivariate time series; Wastewater treatment plants","Brain; Effluent treatment; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Control parameters; Deep learning; Dual stage; Dual-stage attention-based LSTM; Early warning; Effluent quality; Effluent quality prediction; Multivariate time series; Quality prediction; Waste water treatment plants; early warning system; effluent; machine learning; multivariate analysis; performance assessment; time series analysis; wastewater treatment plant; adult; article; attention; controlled study; deep learning; effluent; long short term memory network; long term memory; memory; noise; pharmaceutics; prediction; temporal attention; time series analysis; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Effluents","Academic Press","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

The immune mechanism of IA is more complicated, and it is unclear so far. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to explore the immune related molecular mechanism of IA. Methods: All data were downloaded from the public database. Limma package and ssGSEA algorithm was used to identify differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) and analyze immune cell infiltration, respectively. Machine learning and cytoscape-cytohubba plug-in was used to identify key immune types and multicentric DEmRNAs of IA, respectively. Multicentric DEmRNAs related to key immune cells were screened out as key DEmRNAs by Spearman correlation analysis. Diagnostic models, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory network and transcription factor regulatory network were constructed based on key DEmRNAs. Meanwhile, drugs related to key DEmRNAs were screened out based on DGIdb database. The expression of key DEmRNAs was also verified by real time-PCR. Results: In this study, 7 key DEmRNAs (NRXN1, GRIA2, SLC1A2, SLC17A7, IL6, VEGFA and SYP) associated with key differential immune cell infiltration (CD56bright natural killer cell, Immature B cell and Type 1 T helper cell) were identified. Functional enrichment analysis showed that VEGFA and IL6 may be involved in the regulation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Moreover, IL6 was also found to be enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction signaling pathway. In the ceRNA regulatory network, a large number of miRNAs and lncRNAs were found. In the transcription factor regulatory network, the transcription factor SP1 was correlated with VEGFA, SYP and IL6. It is also predicted that drugs related to key DEmRNAs such as CARBOPLATIN, FENTANYL and CILOSTAZOL may contribute to the treatment of IA. In addition, it was also found that SVM and RF models based on key DEmRNAs may be potential markers for diagnosing IA and unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA), respectively.

Each class of CV represents a snapshot along an evolutionary journey, one with the potential to trigger a type Ia supernova event. The study of CVs offers valuable insights into binary evolution and accretion physics, with the rarest examples potentially providing the deepest insights. However, the escalating number of detected transients, coupled with our limited capacity to investigate them all, poses challenges in identifying such rarities. Machine learning (ML) plays a pivotal role in addressing this issue by facilitating the categorization of each detected transient into its respective transient class. Leveraging these techniques, we have developed a two-stage pipeline tailored to the Zwicky Transient Facility transient alert stream. The first stage is alerts filter aimed at removing non-CVs, while the latter is an ML classifier produced using Extreme Gradient Boosting, achieving a macro average area under the curve score of 0.92 for distinguishing between CV classes. By utilizing the generative topographic mapping algorithm with classifier posterior probabilities as input, we obtain representations indicating that CV evolutionary factors play a role in classifier performance, while the associated feature maps present a potent tool for identifying the features deemed most relevant for distinguishing between classes. Implementation of the pipeline in 2023 June yielded 51 intriguing candidates that are yet to be reported as CVs or classified with further granularity. Our classifier represents a significant step in the discovery and classification of different CV classes, a domain of research still in its infancy.  © 2023 The Author(s).

However, the validity of the adopted mean function and hyperparameters, and the dependence of the results on the choice have not been well explored. In this paper, we study the effects of the underlying mean function and the hyperparameter selection on the reconstruction of the distance moduli from type Ia supernovae. We show that the choice of an arbitrary mean function affects the reconstruction: a zero mean function leads to unphysical distance moduli and the best-fit ΛCDM to biased reconstructions. We propose to marginalize over a family of mean functions and over the hyperparameters to effectively remove their impact on the reconstructions.

Methods: Prospective cohort studies in Finland, Germany, Sweden and the USA followed 24,662 children at increased genetic or familial risk of developing islet autoimmunity and diabetes. For the 1403 who developed IAbs (523 of whom developed diabetes), levels of autoantibodies against insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and insulinoma-associated antigen-2 (IA-2A) were harmonised for analysis. Diabetes prediction models using multivariate logistic regression with inverse probability censored weighting (IPCW) were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. Discriminative power for disease was estimated using the IPCW concordance index (C index) with 95% CI estimated via bootstrap. Results: A baseline model with covariates for data source, sex, diabetes family history, HLA risk group and age at seroconversion with a 10-year follow-up period yielded a C index of 0.61 (95% CI 0.58, 0.63). The performance improved after adding the IAb positivity status for IAA, GADA and IA-2A at seroconversion: C index 0.72 (95% CI 0.71, 0.74). Using the IAb levels instead of positivity indicators resulted in even better performance: C index 0.76 (95% CI 0.74, 0.77). The predictive power was maintained when using the IAb levels alone: C index 0.76 (95% CI 0.75, 0.76). The prediction was better for shorter follow-up periods, with a C index of 0.82 (95% CI 0.81, 0.83) at 2 years, and remained reasonable for longer follow-up periods, with a C index of 0.76 (95% CI 0.75, 0.76) at 11 years. Inclusion of the results of a third IAb test added to the predictive power, and a suitable interval between seroconversion and the third test was approximately 1.5 years, with a C index of 0.78 (95% CI 0.77, 0.78) at 10 years follow-up. Conclusions/interpretation: Consideration of quantitative patterns of IAb levels improved the predictive power for type 1 diabetes in IAb-positive children beyond qualitative IAb positivity status.

In this study, we propose a dual-level augmentation strategy incorporating image-level augmentation (IA) and feature-level augmentation (FA) to tackle class imbalance and improve the predictive performance of radiomics for meningioma grading on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Methods: This study recruited 160 consecutive patients with pathologically proven meningioma (129 low-grade (WHO grade I) tumors; 31 high-grade (WHO grade II and III) tumors) with preoperative multisequence MRI imaging. A dual-level augmentation strategy combining IA and FA was applied and evaluated in 100 repetitions in 3-, 5-, and 10-fold cross-validation. Results: The best area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of our method in 100 repetitions was ≥0.78 in all cross-validations. The corresponding cross-validation sensitivities (cross-validation specificity) were 0.72 (0.69), 0.76 (0.71), and 0.63 (0.82) in 3-, 5-, and 10-fold cross-validation, respectively. The proposed method achieved significantly better performance and distribution of results, outperforming single-level augmentation (IA or FA) or no augmentation in each cross-validation. Conclusions: The dual-level augmentation strategy using IA and FA significantly improves the performance of the radiomics model for meningioma grading on MRI, allowing better radiomics-based preoperative stratification and individualized treatment. © 2023 by the authors.","data augmentation; machine learning; magnetic resonance imaging; meningioma; radiomics","adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cancer grading; cell structure; chemoradiotherapy; clinical decision making; cross validation; decision tree; diagnostic test accuracy study; discriminant analysis; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; image quality; image segmentation; k nearest neighbor; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; meningioma; neuroradiologist; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; radiomics; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; T1 weighted imaging; T2 weighted imaging; Youden index","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

These tools are particularly interesting in medical contexts, in order to evaluate the variables from patients’ screening analysis and disentangle the information that they contain. We propose in this work a novel method for evaluating the role of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals in the human cognitive decline. This framework offers a complete solution for all the steps in the classification pipeline, from the preprocessing of the raw signals to the final classification stage. Numerous metrics are computed from the original data in terms of different domains (time, frequency, etc.), and dimensionality is reduced through a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting characteristics are used as inputs of different classifiers (linear/non-linear Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, etc.) to determine the amount of information that they contain. Our system yielded an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.80 identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients, showing that ECG contain crucial information for predicting the appearance of this pathology.

Among them, the few-shot learning (FSL) technique demonstrates excellent processing capability under limited labeled samples. Nevertheless, the current FSL-based works provide scarce attention to effective class prototypes and metric types, resulting in high generalization error and poor interpretation during the cross-domain testing phase. A dual-adjustment mode-based cross-domain meta-learning (DMCM) method for few-shot HSI classification is proposed to tackle this issue. Specifically, a three-dimensional ghost attention network (TGAN) with strong learning capability without massive parameters is first constructed. Meanwhile, a dual-adjustment mode comprising intracorrection (IC) and interalignment (IA) learning strategies is then adopted to solve domain shift issue via episode-level meta-tasks, where IC and IA focus on effective class prototypes and data distribution differences between domains, respectively. Afterward, considering that the traditional Euclidean distance metric is insensitive to the distribution of within-class samples, the class-covariance metric (CCM) is employed to account for the distribution in feature space of each class to optimize decision boundary and alleviate the misclassification problem. Extensive experiments on three publicly available target hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Clinically, due to the obvious differences in the position, shape, and size of the lesion structure in different scanning directions, ophthalmologists usually need to combine the lesion structure in the OCT images in the horizontal and vertical scanning directions to diagnose the type of pathological changes in PM. To address these challenges, we propose a novel feature interaction Transformer network (FIT-Net) to diagnose PM using OCT images, which consists of two dual-scale Transformer (DST) blocks and an interactive attention (IA) unit. Specifically, FIT-Net divides image features of different scales into a series of feature block sequences. In order to enrich the feature representation, we propose an IA unit to realize the interactive learning of class token in feature sequences of different scales. The interaction between feature sequences of different scales can effectively integrate different scale image features, and hence FIT-Net can focus on meaningful lesion regions to improve the PM classification performance. Finally, by fusing the dual-view image features in the horizontal and vertical scanning directions, we propose six dual-view feature fusion methods for PM diagnosis.

As it becomes simpler for cybercriminals to launch novel assaults, the scale and complexity of today's networks continue to grow. Therefore, it is crucial to create an efficient instruction detection system (IDS) capable of constantly monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity and issuing alerts as necessary. Several researchers have employed machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to create an effective IDS. Amongst, an effective IDS detection model convolutional neural network (CNN)- long short term memory (LSTM extracts temporal and geographical aspects of network traffic to lower the false alarm rate (FAR) and raise the detection rate (DR). However, the epistemic uncertainty in intrusion data affect the efficiency of CNN-LSTM model. This paper handle uncertainty information by proposing a multivalued neutrosophic convolutional LSTM (MVN-ConvLSTM) which extracts different deep features. MVN-ConvLSTM uses a neutrosophic set (NS) which considers truth (T), indeterminacy (I), and falsity (F) memberships of every features. First, the intrusion features are mapped to NS domain as six sets, positive degree of truth-membership (TA), positive degree of falsity membership (FA), Positive degree of indeterminate towards falsity and indeterminate towards truth membership (IA), negative degree of truth-membership (TB), negative degree of falsity membership (IB), and negative degree of indeterminate towards falsity and indeterminate towards truth membership (IB). Next, an MVN-ConvLSTM is generated with four parallel paths, two of which take input from T and two from I, and a suitable combination of these paths is used to produce the output. The weights of the neural network are updated in four different directions at once using a back propagation approach. The efficiency of MVN-ConvLSTM to handle uncertainty in intrusion dataset is proved by comparing conventional CNN models which provides lower FAR and high DR. Finally, the test results show that the MVN-ConvLSTM achieves accuracy value of 94.63%, 92.84% and 91.84% on three different datasets CIC-IDS2018, WSN-DS and UNSW-NB15. © (2023), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

Rainfall, being one of the defining factors for a flooding event, is rarely modeled singularly in deep learning, as it is usually performed in multivariate analysis. This study will attempt to explore a time series modeling method in four subcatchments located in Samar, Philippines. In this study, the rainfall time series was treated as a signal and was reconstructed into a combination of a ‘smoothened’ or ‘denoised’ signal, and a ‘detailed’ or noise signal. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method was used as a reconstruction technique, in combination with the univariate long short-term memory (LSTM) network method. The combination of the two methods showed consistently high values of performance indicators, such as Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), correlation coefficient (CC), Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE), index of agreement (IA), and Legates–McCabe index (LMI), with mean average percentage error (MAPE) values at almost zero, and consistently low values for both residual mean square error (RMSE) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR).

Real-time thermal comfort assessment can enormously contribute to thermal comfort optimization and energy conservation in buildings. Existing thermal comfort models mainly utilize classification algorithms to identify personal thermal comfort states, resulting in significant information loss. In addition, existing thermal comfort studies mainly use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) feature extraction to compute the power of the Low-frequency (LF) and High-frequency (HF) bands of the R–R intervals (RRIs), resulting in the insufficient use of the information in the RRIs. To account for these concerns, this study defines personal thermal sensation as a continuous function of time, and investigates using the Hilbert Transform (HT) to extract the instantaneous amplitude (iA) of the LF and HF for thermal comfort modeling. Moreover, a novel continuous thermal sensation acquisition system has been designed to obtain the subjects’ approximate continuous thermal sensation. The FFT-based HRV features, HT-based HRV features, and time-domain HRV features have all been shown to be relevant for personal thermal comfort modeling. By utilizing machine learning regressions, it is feasible to combine the HT-based HRV features and other HRV features together to boost personal thermal comfort prediction accuracy. The subjects’ personal thermal comfort prediction reached the highest average coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.73 by using all the HRV features together. This study facilitates practical applications for wearable thermal comfort assessment frameworks and contributes to energy conservation in buildings. © 2022","Energy conservation; Fast Fourier Transform; Heartbeat sensor; Hilbert transform; Machine learning; Physiological index","Classification (of information); Frequency domain analysis; Heart; Historic preservation; Machine learning; Thermal comfort; Heart rate variability; Heartbeat sensor; Hilbert transform; In-buildings; Low-high; Lower frequencies; Machine-learning; Physiological indices; Thermal comfort models; Thermal sensations; Fast Fourier transforms","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

For example, it is known that the presence of flying debris and Dust Devils on the Martian surface can partially damage sensors present in rovers/landers. The objective of this work is to show how data-driven methods can improve sensor resilience, particularly in the case of complex sensors, with multiple intermediate variables, feeding an inverse algorithm (IA) based on calibration data. The method considers three phases: an initial phase in which the sensor is calibrated in the laboratory and an IA is designed; a second phase, in which the sensor is placed at its intended location and sensor data is used to train data-driven model; and a third phase, once the model has been trained and partial damage is detected, in which the data-driven algorithm is reducing errors. The proposed method is tested with the intermediate data of the wind sensor of the TWINS instrument (NASA InSight mission), consisting of two booms placed on the deck of the lander, and three boards per boom. Wind speed and angle are recovered from the intermediate variables provided by the sensor and predicted by the proposed method. A comparative analysis of various data-driven methods including machine learning and deep learning (DL) methods is carried out for the proposed research. It is shown that even a simple method such as k-nearest neighbor is capable of successfully recovering missing data of a board compared to complex DL models. Depending on the selected missing board, errors are reduced by a factor between 2.43 and 4.78, for horizontal velocity; and by a factor between 1.74 and 4.71, for angle, compared with the situation of using only the two remaining boards. © 2023 The Author(s).

In orthodontics, systems have been developed which, assisted by AI, can make therapeutic decisions and perform analyses. There is no updated compendium on the use of AI in orthodontics. Objectives: To describe the uses of AI in orthodontics according to the current literature. Methodology: A narrative review was performed in the Medline and SciELO bases by means of the following search: (orthodont*) AND (“machine learning” OR “deep learning” OR “artificial intelligence” OR “neural network”). Results: 19 articles were obtained, showing that AI has been developed in four areas: 1) IA assisted cephalometry, where localization of cephalometric points and cephalometric analysis showed equal accuracy than orthodontists. 2) Unerupted tooth localization with CBCT, with similar results between AI and orthodontists. 3) Determination of skeletal age, which is more efficient with AI than with conventional methods. 4) Facial analysis, where AI allows an objective evaluation of facial attractiveness with applications in diagnosis and surgical planning. 5) Therapeutic decisions with AI, to determine the need for exodontia and teeth to be extracted. Discussion: AI is being incorporated rapidly in orthodontics, so we must know concepts and possibilities that it gives us in orthodontics. Conclusions: An increasing number of articles refer to the uses of AI in orthodontics, with similar results to those obtained by specialists. However, the evidence is still scarce and mainly experimental, so AI should still be used with caution in orthodontics. © 2022, Ediciones Avances S.L..

Methods: We developed a multiplexed proteomics assay for determining disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19. The assay quantifies up to 50 peptides, derived from 30 known and newly introduced COVID-19-related protein markers, in a single measurement using routine-lab compatible analytical flow rate liquid chromatography and multiple reaction monitoring (LC-MRM). We conducted two observational studies in patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany before (from March 1 to 26, 2020, n=30) and after (from April 4 to November 19, 2020, n=164) dexamethasone became standard of care. The study is registered in the German and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry (DRKS00021688). Findings: The assay produces reproducible (median inter-batch CV of 10.9%) absolute quantification of 47 peptides with high sensitivity (median LLOQ of 143 ng/ml) and accuracy (median 96.8%). In both studies, the assay reproducibly captured hallmarks of COVID-19 infection and severity, as it distinguished healthy individuals, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19. In the post-dexamethasone cohort, the assay predicted survival with an accuracy of 0.83 (108/130), and death with an accuracy of 0.76 (26/34) in the median 2.5 weeks before the outcome, thereby outperforming compound clinical risk assessments such as SOFA, APACHE II, and ABCS scores. Interpretation: Disease severity and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 can be stratified and predicted by the routine-applicable panel assay that combines known and novel COVID-19 biomarkers. The prognostic value of this assay should be prospectively assessed in larger patient cohorts for future support of clinical decisions, including evaluation of sample flow in routine setting. The possibility to objectively classify COVID-19 severity can be helpful for monitoring of novel therapies, especially in early clinical trials.

How to accurately assess the rupture risk of IAs remains a challenge in clinical decision-making. Purpose: We aim to build an integrated model to improve the assessment of the rupture risk of IAs. Materials and Methods: A total of 148 (39 ruptured and 109 unruptured) IA subjects were retrospectively computed with computational fluid dynamics (CFDs), and the integrated models were proposed by combining machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. ML algorithms that include random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), XGBoost (XGB), support vector machine (SVM), and LightGBM were, respectively, adopted to classify ruptured and unruptured IAs. A Pointnet DL algorithm was applied to extract hemodynamic cloud features from the hemodynamic clouds obtained from CFD. Morphological variables and hemodynamic parameters along with the extracted hemodynamic cloud features were acted as the inputs to the classification models. The classification results with and without hemodynamic cloud features are computed and compared. Results: Without consideration of hemodynamic cloud features, the classification accuracy of RF, KNN, XGB, SVM, and LightGBM was 0.824, 0.759, 0.839, 0.860, and 0.829, respectively, and the AUCs of them were 0.897, 0.584, 0.892, 0.925, and 0.890, respectively. With the consideration of hemodynamic cloud features, the accuracy successively increased to 0.908, 0.873, 0.900, 0.926, and 0.917. Meanwhile, the AUCs reached 0.952, 0.881, 0.950, 0.969, and 0.965 eventually. Adding consideration of hemodynamic cloud features, the SVM could perform best with the highest accuracy of 0.926 and AUC of 0.969, respectively. Conclusion: The integrated model combining ML and DL algorithms could improve the classification of IAs. Adding consideration of hemodynamic cloud features could bring more accurate classification, and hemodynamic cloud features were important for the discrimination of ruptured IAs.

Methods: Thirty-nine unilateral mTLE-HS patients who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy were classified as having completely seizure-free (Engel class IA; n = 22) or non-seizure-free (Engel class IB–IV; n = 17) outcomes at 1 year after surgery. Preoperative [18F]FDG PET and functional MRI (fMRI) were obtained from a simultaneous PET/MRI scanner, and individual glucose metabolism and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) were evaluated by standardizing these with respect to healthy controls. These abnormality measures and clinical data from each patient were incorporated into a machine learning framework (gradient boosting decision tree and logistic regression analysis) to estimate seizure recurrence. The predictive values of features were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in the training and test cohorts. Results: The machine learning classification model showed [18F]FDG PET and fMRI variations in contralateral hippocampal network and age of onset identify unfavorable surgical outcomes effectively. In the validation dataset, the logistic regression model with [18F]FDG PET and fALFF obtained from simultaneous [18F]FDG PET/MRI gained the maximum area under the ROC curve of 0.905 for seizure recurrence, higher than 0.762 with 18[F]-FDG PET, and 0.810 with fALFF alone.

Our study aimed to develop an early diagnosis model and rupture classification model by analyzing plasma metabolic profiles of IA patients. Materials and methods: Plasma samples from a cohort of 105 participants, including 75 IA patients in unruptured and ruptured status (UIA, RIA) and 30 control participants were collected for comprehensive metabolic evaluation using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based pseudotargeted metabolomics method. Furthermore, an integrated machine learning strategy based on LASSO, random forest and logistic regression were used for feature selection and model construction. Results: The metabolic profiling disturbed significantly in UIA and RIA patients. Notably, adenosine content was significantly downregulated in UIA, and various glycine-conjugated secondary bile acids were decreased in RIA patients. Enriched KEGG pathways included glutathione metabolism and bile acid metabolism. Two sets of biomarker panels were defined to discriminate IA and its rupture with the area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.843 and 0.929 on the validation sets, respectively. Conclusions: The present study could contribute to a better understanding of IA etiopathogenesis and facilitate discovery of new therapeutic targets.

The objective of this study was to rapidly identify ICI-IA patients in clinical data and assess associated immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and risk factors. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of the electronic health records (EHRs) of 89 patients who developed ICI-IA out of 2451 cancer patients who received ICI therapy at Northwestern University between March 2011 to January 2021. Logistic regression and random forest machine learning models were trained on all EHR diagnoses, labs, medications, and procedures to identify ICI-IA patients and EHR codes indicating ICI-IA. Multivariate logistic regression was then used to test associations between ICI-IA and cancer type, ICI regimen, and comorbid irAEs. Results: Logistic regression and random forest models identified ICI-IA patients with accuracies of 0.79 and 0.80, respectively. Key EHR features from the random forest model included ICI-IA relevant features (joint pain, steroid prescription, rheumatoid factor tests) and features suggesting comorbid irAEs (thyroid function tests, pruritus, triamcinolone prescription). Compared to 871 adjudicated ICI patients who did not develop arthritis, ICI-IA patients had higher odds of developing cutaneous (odds ratio [OR]=2.66; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.63-4.35), endocrine (OR=2.09; 95% CI 1.15-3.80), or gastrointestinal (OR=2.88; 95% CI 1.76-4.72) irAEs adjusting for demographics, cancer type, and ICI regimen. Melanoma (OR=1.99; 95% CI 1.08-3.65) and renal cell carcinoma (OR=2.03; 95% CI 1.06-3.84) patients were more likely to develop ICI-IA compared to lung cancer patients. Patients on nivolumab+ipilimumab were more likely to develop ICI-IA compared to patients on pembrolizumab (OR=1.86; 95% CI 1.01-3.43). Discussion: Our machine learning models rapidly identified patients with ICI-IA in EHR data and elucidated clinical features indicative of comorbid irAEs. Patients with ICI-IA were significantly more likely to also develop cutaneous, endocrine, and gastrointestinal irAEs during their clinical course compared to ICI therapy patients without ICI-IA.

The proposed method can give the desired control coefficients/references in a simple way because, compared to conventional methods, IAAI only relies on a data-driven process with no need for an optimization process or substantial derivations. Noting that the IAAI approach uses artificial intelligence to provide feasible coefficients/references for the power converter control, rather than building a new controller. After illustrating the IAAI concept, a conventional application method of artificial neural network is discussed, an optimization-based design. Then, a two-source-converter microgrid case is studied to choose the best droop coefficients via the optimization-based approach. After that, the proposed IAAI method is employed for the same microgrid case to quickly find good droop coefficients. Furthermore, the IAAI method is applied to a modular multilevel converter (MMC) case, extending the MMC operation region under unbalanced grid faults. In the MMC case, both simulation and experimental online tests validate the operation, feasibility, and practicality of IAAI.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Artificial intelligence (AI); artificial neural network (ANN); current sharing; droop control; inverse application (IA); machine learning; power converters","Inverse problems; Learning systems; Neural networks; Power control; Power electronics; Artificial intelligence; Artificial neural network; Current-sharing; Droop control; Feedforward systems; Inverse application; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Power-electronics; Power converters","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

The results reveal that it is difficult to control the aqueous copolymerization to obtain PAN copolymer with uniform sequence structure by batch polymerization with one-time feeding.

The 2022 workshop is a continuation of this reflection on AI and intelligent automation (IA) by focusing on its contribution to pharmacovigilance and the applications and tasks could be optimized to preserve and strengthen medical and pharmacological expertise in pharmacovigilance. The evolution of pharmacovigilance work is characterized by many tasks with low added value, a growing volume of pharmacovigilance reporting of suspected side effects, and a scarcity of medical staff with expertise in clinical pharmacology and pharmacovigilance and human resources to support this growing need. Together, these parameters contribute to an embolization of the pharmacovigilance system at risk of missing its primary mission: to identify and characterize a risk or even a health alert on a drug. The participants of the workshop (representatives of the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres (CRPV), the French National Agency for Safety of Medicinal Products (ANSM), patients, the pharmaceutical industry, or start-ups working in the development of AI in the field of medicine) shared their experiences, their pilot projects and their expectations on the expected potential, theoretical or proven, AI and IA. This work has made it possible to identify the needs and challenges that AI or IA represent, in the current or future modes of organization of pharmacovigilance activities. This approach led to the development of a SWOT matrix (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats), a basis for reflection to identify critical points and consider four main recommendations: (1) preserve and develop business expertise in pharmacovigilance (including research and development in methods) with the integration of new technologies; (2) improve the quality of pharmacovigilance reports; (3) adapt technical and regulatory means; (4) implement a development strategy for AI and IA tools at the service of expertise. © 2022","Artificial automation; Artificial intelligence; Evaluation; Interoperability; Machine learning; Pharmacovigilance; Side effects","Article; artificial embolization; artificial intelligence; automation; clinical pharmacology; clinical research; data interoperability; drug industry; feedback system; human; medical staff; personal experience; pharmacovigilance; workshop","Elsevier Masson s.r.l.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Towards molecular prognostics, we hypothesized that circulating blood RNA expression profiles are associated with IA risk. Methods: We performed RNA sequencing on 68 blood samples from IA patients. Here, patients were categorized as either high or low risk by assessment of aneurysm size (≥ 5 mm = high risk) and Population, Hypertension, Age, Size, Earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage, Site (PHASES) score (≥ 1 = high risk). Modified F-statistics and Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction was performed on transcripts per million-normalized gene counts. Protein-coding genes expressed in ≥ 50% of samples with a q value < 0.05 and an absolute fold-change ≥ 2 were considered significantly differentially expressed. Bioinformatics in Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was performed to understand the biology of risk-associated expression profiles. Association was assessed between gene expression and risk via Pearson correlation analysis. Linear discriminant analysis models using significant genes were created and validated for classification of high-risk cases. Results: We analyzed transcriptomes of 68 IA patients. In these cases, 31 IAs were large (≥ 5 mm), while 26 IAs had a high PHASES score. Based on size, 36 genes associated with high-risk IAs, and two were correlated with the size measurement. Alternatively, based on PHASES score, 76 genes associated with high-risk cases, and nine of them showed significant correlation to the score. Similar ontological terms were associated with both gene profiles, which reflected inflammatory signaling and vascular remodeling. Prediction models based on size and PHASES stratification were able to correctly predict IA risk status, with > 80% testing accuracy for both.

Applying digital tissue image analysis to whole-slide imaging may enhance the accuracy and reproducibility of pathological assessment. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of tumour components of lung adenocarcinoma by measuring the dimensions of the tumour consisting elements separately, using a machine learning algorithm. METHODS: Between September 2002 and December 2016, 317 patients with surgically resected, pathological stage IA adenocarcinoma with lepidic components were analysed. We assessed the whole tumour area, including the lepidic components, and measured the epithelium, collagen, elastin areas and alveolar air space. We analysed the prognostic impact of each tumour component. RESULTS: The dimensions of the epithelium and collagen areas were independent significant risk factors for recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio, 8.38; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-61.88; P = 0.037, and hazard ratio, 2.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.14-5.83; P = 0.022, respectively). According to the subgroup analysis when combining the epithelium and collagen areas as risk factors, patients with tumours consisting of both large epithelium and collagen areas showed significantly poor prognoses (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: We assessed tumour components using a machine learning algorithm to stratify the post-operative prognosis of surgically resected stage IA adenocarcinomas. This method might guide the selection of patients with a high risk of recurrence. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

We characterized the relationship between the IA wall appearance, using intraoperative imaging, and the hemodynamics from CFD simulations. Methods: Three-dimensional geometries of 15 IAs were constructed and used for CFD. Two-dimensional intraoperative images were subjected to wall classification using a machine learning approach, after which the wall type was mapped onto the 3D surface. IA wall regions included thick (white), normal (purple-crimson), and thin/translucent (red) regions. IA-wide and local statistical analyses were performed to assess the relationship between hemodynamics and wall type. Results: Thin regions of the IA sac had significantly higher WSS, Normalized WSS, WSS Divergence and Transverse WSS, compared to both normal and thick regions. Thicker regions tended to co-locate with significantly higher RRT than thin regions. These trends were observed on a local scale as well. Regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation between WSS and thin regions and a significant negative correlation between WSSD and thick regions. Conclusion: Hemodynamic simulation results were associated with the intraoperatively observed IA wall type. We consistently found that elevated WSS and WSSNorm were associated with thin regions of the IA wall rather than thick and normal regions. © 2022 by the authors.","aneurysm wall characterization; computational fluid dynamics (CFD); intracranial aneurysm; intraoperative video; relative residence time (RRT); wall shear stress (WSS)","adult; Article; clinical article; computational fluid dynamics; digital subtraction angiography; hemodynamics; human; image analysis; image processing; image registration; intracranial aneurysm; machine learning; regression analysis; retrospective study; shear stress; two-dimensional imaging; videorecording","MDPI","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

A higher level of model prediction accuracy can play a fundamental role in air quality assessment and enhancing human well-being. In this paper, four types of machine learning models—random forest model, ridge regression model, support vector machine model, extremely randomized trees model—were adopted to predict PM2.5 concentration in ten cities in the Jing-Jin-Ji region of north China based on multi-sources spatiotemporal data including air quality and meteorological data in time series. Data were fed into the model by using the rolling prediction method which is proven to improve prediction accuracy in our experiments. Lastly, the comparative experiments show that at the city level, RF and ExtraTrees models have better predictive results with lower mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and higher index of agreement (IA) compared to other selected models. For seasonality, level four models all have the best prediction performances in winter time and the worst in summer time, and RF models have the best prediction performance with the IA ranging from 0.93 to 0.98 with an MAE of 5.91 to 11.68 μg/m3. Consequently, the demonstration of how each model performs differently in each city and each season is expected to shed light on environmental policy implications. © 2023 by the authors.","data mining; extremely randomized trees model; PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction; random forest model; ridge regression model; support vector machine model","China; Jingjinji; Air quality; Data mining; Environmental protection; Forestry; Health risks; Learning systems; Mean square error; Meteorology; Public policy; Regression analysis; Support vector machines; Sustainable development; Extremely randomized tree model; PM 2.5; PM2.5 prediction; Random forest modeling; Randomized trees; Regression modelling; Ridge regression; Ridge regression model; Support vector machine models; Tree modeling; atmospheric modeling; concentration (composition); data mining; machine learning; particulate matter; prediction; spatial data; support vector machine; Forecasting","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We propose a new algorithm based on machine learning, namely the Temporary Convective Network and Light Gradient Boosting Machine Combined with Weight Module Algorithm (TLW). The TLW algorithm can classify the photometric simulation transients data in g, r, i bands provided via PLAsTiCC, typing Tidal Disruption Event (TDE), Kilonova (KN), Type Ia supernova (SNIa), and Type I Super-luminous supernova (SLSN-I). When comparing the real-time classification results of the TLW algorithm and six other algorithms, such as Rapid, we found that the TLW algorithm has the best comprehensive performance indexes and has the advantages of high precision and high efficiency. The average accuracy of TLW is 84.54%. The average implementation timings of the TLW algorithm for classifying four types of transients is 123.09 s, which is based on TensorFlow’s architecture in windows and python. We use three indicators to prove that the TLW algorithm is superior to the classical Rapid algorithm, including Confusion Matrix, PR curve, and ROC curve. We also use the TLW algorithm to classify ZTF real transients. The real-time classification results for ZTF transients show that the accuracy of the TLW algorithm is higher than the other six algorithms. © 2024 by the authors.","light curve; machine learning; photometry; real-time classification; transient","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Current risk assessments are mainly based on clinical and imaging data. This study aimed to develop a molecular assay tool for optimizing the IA risk monitoring system. Methods: Peripheral blood gene expression datasets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus were integrated into a discovery cohort. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and machine learning integrative approaches were utilized to construct a risk signature. QRT-PCR assay was performed to validate the model in an in-house cohort. Immunopathological features were estimated using bioinformatics methods. Results: A four-gene machine learning-derived gene signature (MLDGS) was constructed for identifying patients with IA rupture. The AUC of MLDGS was 1.00 and 0.88 in discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. Calibration curve and decision curve analysis also confirmed the good performance of the MLDGS model. MLDGS was remarkably correlated with the circulating immunopathologic landscape. Higher MLDGS scores may represent higher abundance of innate immune cells, lower abundance of adaptive immune cells, and worse vascular stability. Conclusions: The MLDGS provides a promising molecular assay panel for identifying patients with adverse immunopathological features and high risk of aneurysm rupture, contributing to advances in IA precision medicine.

We previously developed the MxPancreasScore comprising 9 analytes and serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), achieving an accuracy of 90.6%. The necessity for 5 different analytical platforms and multiple analytical runs, however, hindered clinical applicability. We therefore aimed to develop a simpler single-analytical run, single-platform diagnostic signature. Methods: We evaluated 941 patients (PDAC, 356; chronic pancreatitis [CP], 304; nonpancreatic disease, 281) in 3 multicenter independent tests, and identification (ID) and validation cohort 1 (VD1) and 2 (VD2) were evaluated. Targeted quantitative plasma metabolite analysis was performed on a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry platform. A machine learning–aided algorithm identified an improved (i-Metabolic) and minimalistic metabolic (m-Metabolic) signatures, and compared them for performance. Results: The i-Metabolic Signature, (12 analytes plus CA19-9) distinguished PDAC from CP with area under the curve (95% confidence interval) of 97.2% (97.1%-97.3%), 93.5% (93.4%-93.7%), and 92.2% (92.1%-92.3%) in the ID, VD1, and VD2 cohorts, respectively. In the VD2 cohort, the m-Metabolic signature (4 analytes plus CA19-9) discriminated PDAC from CP with a sensitivity of 77.3% and specificity of 89.6%, with an overall accuracy of 82.4%. For the subset of 45 patients with PDAC with resectable stages IA-IIB tumors, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 73.2%, 89.6%, and 82.7%, respectively; for those with detectable CA19-9 >2 U/mL, 81.6%, 88.7%, and 84.5%, respectively; and for those with CA19-9 <37 U/mL, 39.7%, 94.1%, and 76.3%, respectively. Conclusions: The single-platform, single-run, m-Metabolic signature of just 4 metabolites used in combination with serum CA19-9 levels is an innovative accurate diagnostic tool for PDAC at the time of clinical presentation, warranting further large-scale evaluation. © 2022 The Authors","CA19-9; Chronic Pancreatitis; Diagnostic Signature; Metabolic Signature; Pancreatic Cancer","Biomarkers, Tumor; CA-19-9 Antigen; Carbohydrates; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Reference Standards; ROC Curve; acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; antidiabetic agent; antigout agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; bilirubin; biological marker; CA 19-9 antigen; ceramide; histidine; lysophosphatidylethanolamine; pancreas enzyme; phosphatidylethanolamine; proline; proton pump inhibitor; sphingomyelin; triacylglycerol; tryptophan; unclassified drug; CA 19-9 antigen; carbohydrate; tumor marker; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cancer staging; cholecystectomy; chronic pancreatitis; clinical practice; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; elective surgery; female; hernioplasty; human; human tissue; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; lymph node metastasis; machine learning; major clinical study; male; metastasis; pancreatic ductal carcinoma; practice guideline; protein blood level; sensitivity and specificity; technology; thyroidectomy; case control study; chronic pancreatitis; clinical trial; multicenter study; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas tumor; pathology; receiver operating characteristic; standard","W.B.

Methods: GSE122897, GSE75436, GSE15629, and GSE75434 datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (DEFRGs) were selected to construct a diagnostic model integrating with machine learning. Then, a consensus clustering algorithm was performed to classify IA patients into distinct ferroptosis-related clusters. Functional analyses, including GO, KEGG, GSVA, and GSEA analyses, were conducted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. ssGSEA and xCell algorithms were performed to uncover the immune characteristics. Results: We identified 28 DEFRGs between IAs and controls from the GSE122897 dataset. GO and KEGG results showed that these genes were enriched in cytokine activity, ferroptosis, and the IL-17 signaling pathway. Immune analysis showed that the IAs had higher levels of immune infiltration. A four FRGs model (MT3, CDKN1A, ZEP69B, and ABCC1) was established and validated with great IA diagnostic ability. We divided the IA samples into two clusters and found that cluster 2 had a higher proportion of rupture and immune infiltration. We identified 10 ferroptosis phenotypes-related markers in IAs.

Our aim was to improve the accuracy of prognostic prediction and provide personalized treatment plans to enhance patient outcomes. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 152 surgically treated patients with pathologically confirmed stage IA–IIIA NSCLC. These patients were randomly divided into a training cohort and a test cohort in an 8:2 ratio. Using the 3D Slicer image computing platform, we manually delineated the regions of interest (ROI) for all lesions and extracted radiomics features using Python. We used the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to select the radiomics features, while the COX multivariate regression model was employed to identify independent clinical risk factors for recurrence. Finally, we utilized logistic regression (LR) to build the model and validated it using the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index), and the clinical value of the model was compared through decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: We extracted a total of 1562 radiomics features. After feature selection, we retained 29 features. The COX multivariate regression model demonstrated that the N stage was an independent risk factor for postoperative recurrence. In the training and test cohorts, the area under the curve (AUC) values of the radiomics-clinical comprehensive model were 0.972 and 0.937, respectively, while the C-index values were 0.815 and 0.847. These values surpassed those of the standalone clinical model or radiomics model. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that a comprehensive model based on CT radiomics and clinical features can effectively stratify the risk of postoperative recurrence in patients with operable NSCLC. It provides a powerful tool for accurately stratifying the risk of high-risk patients after surgery. © 2023 The Association of University Radiologists","Machine learning; Non-small cell lung cancer; Prognosis; Radiomics; Recurrence","","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Article in press","Scopus"

However, the cell architecture and inflammation in the IA dome remain less understood. METHODS AND RESULTS: Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on ruptured and unruptured human IA domes for delineating the cell atlas, gene expression perturbations, and inflammation features. Two external bulk mRNA sequencing–based data sets and serological results of 126 patients were collected for validation. As a result, a total of 21 332 qualified cells were captured. Vascular cells, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and pericytes, were assigned in extremely sparse numbers (4.84%), and were confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Pericytes, characterized by ABCC9 and HIGD1B, were identified in the IA dome for the first time. Abundant immune cells were identified, with the proportion of monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils being remarkably higher in ruptured IA. The lymphocyte compartment was also thoroughly categorized. By leveraging external data sets and machine learning algorithms, macrophages were robustly associated with IA rupture, irrespective of their polarization status. The single nucleotide polymorphism rs2280543, which is identified in East Asian populations, was associated with macrophage metabolic reprogramming through regulating TALDO1 expression.

Methods: GSE122897 and GSE13353 datasets were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus. Data extracted from GSE122897 were used for analyzing differential gene expression, and consensus clustering was performed to identify stable molecular subtypes. Clinical characteristics were compared between subgroups, and fast gene set enrichment analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis were performed. Hub genes were identified via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis. Predictive models were constructed based on hub genes using the Light Gradient Boosting Machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and logistic regression algorithm. Immune cell infiltration in IA samples was analyzed using Microenvironment Cell Population counter, CIBERSORT, and xCell algorithm. The correlation between hub genes and immune cells was analyzed. The predictive model and immune cell infiltration were validated using data from the GSE13353 dataset. Results: A total of 43 IA samples were classified into 2 subgroups based on gene expression profiles. Subgroup I had a higher risk of rupture, while 70% of subgroup II remained unruptured. In subgroup I, specific genes were associated with inflammation and immunity, and weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed that the black module genes were linked to IA rupture. We identified 4 hub genes (spermine synthase, macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, zymogen granule protein 16B, and LIM and calponin-homology domains 1), which constructed predictive models with good diagnostic performance in differentiating between ruptured and unruptured IA samples. Monocytic lineage was found to be a significant factor in IA rupture, and the 4 hub genes were linked to monocytic lineage (P < 0.05). Conclusions: We reveal a new molecular subtype that can reflect the actual pathological state of IA rupture, and our predictive models constructed by machine learning algorithms can efficiently predict IA rupture. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Immune processes; Inflammation; Intracranial aneurysms rupture; Machine learning; Molecular subtype","Aneurysm, Ruptured; Humans; Inflammation; Intracranial Aneurysm; Machine Learning; Transcriptome; calponin; cytokine receptor; interleukin 12; interleukin 4; interleukin 8; LIM and calponin homology domains 1; macrophage receptor with collagenous structure; receptor; spermine synthase; transcriptome; unclassified drug; zymogen granule; zymogen granule protein 16B; transcriptome; algorithm; Article; B lymphocyte activation; brain artery aneurysm rupture; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell adhesion; cell differentiation; cell infiltration; cell lineage; cell organelle; cell population; cell proliferation; chromosome segregation; CIBERSORT algorithm; controlled study; cytokine production; cytotoxic lymphocyte; dendritic cell; differential gene expression; eosinophil; extreme gradient boosting; functional enrichment analysis; gamma delta T lymphocyte; gene expression profiling; gene identification; gene ontology; gene set enrichment analysis; human; immune signaling; immunocompetent cell; immunoregulation; intracranial aneurysm; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; leukocyte adherence; light gradient boosting machine; logistic regression analysis; lymphocyte proliferation; M1 macrophage; M2 macrophage; machine learning; mast cell; microenvironment cell population counter; molecular biology; monocyte; mononuclear cell; myeloid dendritic cell; natural killer cell; nervous system inflammation; neutrophil; nuclear division; predictive model; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; regulatory mechanism; T lymphocyte activation; transcriptomics; unruptured intracranial aneurysm; upregulation; weighted gene co expression network analysis; xCell algorithm; aneurysm rupture; inflammation; machine learning; pathology","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We presented the first explainability comparison of six commonly used ML algorithms: multivariate logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN), and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). A total of 112 IAs with known rupture status were selected for this study. The ML-based classification used two anatomical features, nine hemodynamic parameters, and thirteen morphologic variables. We utilized permutation feature importance, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithms to explain and analyze 6 Ml algorithms. All models performed comparably: LR area under the curve (AUC) was 0.71; SVM AUC was 0.76; RF AUC was 0.73; XGBoost AUC was 0.78; MLPNN AUC was 0.73; BART AUC was 0.73. Our interpretability analysis demonstrated consistent results across all the methods; i.e., the utility of the top 12 features was broadly consistent. Furthermore, contributions of 9 important features (aneurysm area, aneurysm location, aneurysm type, wall shear stress maximum during systole, ostium area, the size ratio between aneurysm width, (parent) vessel diameter, one standard deviation among time-averaged low shear area, and one standard deviation of temporally averaged low shear area less than 0.4 Pa) were nearly the same. This research suggested that ML classifiers can provide explainable predictions consistent with general domain knowledge concerning IA rupture. With the improved understanding of ML algorithms, clinicians’ trust in ML algorithms will be enhanced, accelerating their clinical translation. © 2023 The Author(s).

Few studies have used an appropriate method of feature selection combined with machine learning by analyzing transcriptomic sequencing data to identify new molecular biomarkers. Following gene ontology (GO) and enrichment analysis, we found that the distinct status of IAs could lead to differential innate immune responses using all 913 differentially expressed genes, and considering that there are numerous irrelevant and redundant genes, we propose a mixed filter- and wrapper-based feature selection. First, we used the Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF) algorithm to filter a large number of irrelevant and redundant genes in the raw dataset, and then used the wrapper feature selection method based on the he Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), accuracy (ACC) and mean square error (MSE) were then used as the evaluation criteria. Finally, we constructed a novel 10-gene signature (YIPF1, RAB32, WDR62, ANPEP, LRRCC1, AADAC, GZMK, WBP2NL, PBX1, and TOR1B) by the proposed two-stage hybrid algorithm FCBF-MLP-PSO and used different machine learning models to predict the rupture status in IAs. The highest ACC value increased from 0.817 to 0.919 (12.5% increase), the highest area under ROC curve (AUC) value increased from 0.87 to 0.94 (8.0% increase), and all evaluation metrics improved by approximately 10% after being processed by our proposed gene selection algorithm. Therefore, these 10 informative genes used to predict rupture status of IAs can be used as complements to imaging examinations in the clinic, meanwhile, this selected gene signature also provides new targets and approaches for the treatment of ruptured IAs.

IA is typically mapped using Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) agricultural census and remote sensing indices. Recent advances in machine learning and sampling techniques further improve IA mapping. However, the relative performances of different IA mapping approaches and their capability in capturing long-term IA temporal variability remain unknown. Here, 1861 county-level IA information from Government Censored Data (GCD) during 2000–2021 are collected, cross-validated, and employed to evaluate commonly used gridded IA data sets. Results show that IA data sets based on the direct interpolation of FAO agricultural census can accurately capture the spatial distribution of IA. However, FAO statistics are only available in a particular year, which cannot capture inter-annual irrigation variations. In contrast, IA products solely based on vegetation indices are prone to positive biases over humid regions due to the lack of contrast in vegetation dynamics. Overall, the latest GCD-based machine learning IA data sets are relatively more accurate, but they are also problematic in estimating IA trends due to the use of temporally static training samples. Such biases are tightly related to agricultural suitability (AS calculated using precipitation and potential evapotranspiration). This suggests that AS should be employed as an endogenous variable in future machine learning based IA mapping algorithms. © 2024. American Geophysical Union.

However, the complex involvement of a variety of factors in this process has hindered the efficient assessment of the process performance such as accurately determining the membrane flux. It is therefore indispensable to search for reliable and flexible tools for the estimation of membrane flux in reverse osmosis such as machine learning. In this study, for the first time, nine different machine learning algorithms, ranging from simple white box models to complex black box models, were investigated for the accurate prediction of membrane flux in reverse osmosis using a large dataset of 401 experimental points retrieved from literature with 8 distinct features. The investigation has shown superior predictive performance for ensemble models over single models. In addition, extreme gradient boosting stood out as the best-performing ensemble model for the prediction of membrane flux due to having the lowest statistical errors (MAE = 1.78 LMH, MAPE = 8.88 %, and RMSE = 2.32 LMH) and strongest correlations with R2 = 98.2 %, IA = 99.55 %, and KGE = 98.84 %, in the test dataset. The Unified Shapley Additive Explanation technique was also employed to determine the influence of the input features, and the most impactful parameters were found to be the feedwater flow rate and applied pressure. The results of the present study suggest that machine learning algorithms, especially ensemble ones, are powerful tools in forecasting the membrane flux of the reverse osmosis process. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Ensemble models; Machine learning; Membrane flux; Reverse osmosis; Single models","","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Previous models for screening TSHR agonists were built on imbalanced datasets and lacked applicability domain (AD) characterization essential for regulatory application. Herein, an updated TSHR agonist dataset was built, for which the ratio of active to inactive compounds greatly increased to 1:2.6, and chemical spaces of structure-activity landscapes (SALs) were enhanced. Resulting models based on 7 molecular representations and 4 ML algorithms were proven to outperform previous ones. Weighted similarity density (ρs) and weighted inconsistency of activities (IA) were proposed to characterize the SALs, and a state-of-the-art AD characterization methodology ADSAL{ρs, IA} was established. An optimal classifier developed with PubChem fingerprints and the random forest algorithm, coupled with ADSAL{ρs ≥ 0.15, IA ≤ 0.65}, exhibited good performance on the validation set with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve being 0.984 and balanced accuracy being 0.941 and identified 90 TSHR agonist classes that could not be found previously. The classifier together with the ADSAL{ρs, IA} may serve as efficient tools for screening EDCs, and the AD characterization methodology may be applied to other ML models. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","","Algorithms; Benchmarking; Endocrine Disruptors; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Receptors, Thyrotropin; endocrine disruptor; thyrotropin receptor; endocrine disruptor; Article; classifier; machine learning; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; structure activity relation; algorithm; benchmarking; chemistry; machine learning","American Chemical Society","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

This paper proposes a new framework to realize battery state of health (SOH) estimation and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. The variable forgetting factor online sequential extreme learning machine (VFOS-ELM) is used to estimate battery SOH, and particle filter (PF) algorithm used to predict battery RUL. To improve the estimation accuracy, a new nonlinear decline method, adaptive weight and Gaussian variation are used to improve the standard whale optimization algorithm (WOA) algorithm. And the improved IWOA algorithm is used for parameter optimization of the VFOS-ELM and PF algorithm. The extremely randomized trees (ERT) algorithm is used to obtain the features with high correlation with the available capacity to reduce the complexity of the model and improve the estimation accuracy. Compared with other methods, the proposed IWOA-VFOS-ELM algorithm has higher estimation performance and noise anti-interference ability. The MAE of APR-3 and APR-4 for SOH estimation are both within 0.12 %, RMSE are within 0.15 %, and IA are both higher than 99.9 %. Compared with PF algorithm, the RUL prediction accuracy obtained by IWOA-PF algorithm is improved by 7.143 %, 6.445 % and 15.094, respectively.

Existing triaging methods from primary care to secondary care are labor-intensive processes that involve manually reviewing referral data from multiple sources and can cause long referral to treatment time. There has been no research using machine learning methods that automatically analyzes heterogeneous data including referral letters to recognize regularities to support the primary to secondary care triage. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous data-driven hybrid machine learning model including Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve hospital triage efficiency at the point of triage. The proposed model achieved a precision of 0.83, recall of 0.82, F1-Score of 0.83, accuracy of 0.82, AUC of 0.90 in identifying patients with non-inflammatory conditions (NIC) and inflammatory arthritis (IA) at the point of triage with explainable risk stratifications. Our model is piloted in a real-world trial in a large secondary care hospital in the UK to compare referral accuracy and time saved between our model and clinicians, and evaluate its acceptability by users. Our model achieved precision and recall of 0.83 and 0.81, compared with the precision and recall of 0.80 and 0.78 by clinicians. The research also shows that our model enabled decision support can save clinicians 8 h per week in assessing the referral assessment.

However, the intrinsic property of FCNs is that as the encoder deepens, higher-level features are learned, and the receptive field size of the network increases, which results in unsatisfactory performance for detecting low-level small/thin structures such as atrial walls and small arteries. To address this issue, we propose to keep the different encoding layer features at their original sizes to constrain the receptive field from increasing as the network goes deeper. Accordingly, we develop a novel S-shaped multiple cross-aggregation segmentation architecture named S-Net, which has two branches in the encoding stage, i.e., a resampling branch to capture low-level fine-grained details and thin/small structures and a downsampling branch to learn high-level discriminative knowledge. In particular, these two branches learn complementary features by residual cross-aggregation; the fusion of the complementary features from different decoding layers can be effectively accomplished through lateral connections. Meanwhile, we perform supervised prediction at all decoding layers to incorporate coarse-level features with high semantic meaning and fine-level features with high localization capability to detect multi-scale structures, especially for small/thin volumes fully. To validate the effectiveness of our S-Net, we conducted extensive experiments on the segmentation of cardiac wall and intracranial aneurysm (IA) vasculature, and quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrated the superior performance of our method for predicting small/thin structures in medical images.

In computational mechanics in particular, complex systems that use model cascading under uncertainty include important safety-critical applications (e.g., aerospace and nuclear reactor systems). There are two fundamental considerations to solve problems with cascading models. First, the collaborating models involved in solving the problem must share compatible data formats and modeling assumptions. Second, the models must be capable of processing and propagating the uncertainty on the raw measurements and the uncertainty on the predictions from other models. The first consideration is often well-understood and implemented in practice. On the other hand, the second consideration, despite its importance, is less understood and implemented. We argue that in such complex engineering systems it is necessary to employ models capable of processing data uncertainty to obtain reliable predictions for the problem. One main difficulty in uncertainty quantification is that there is often not enough information about the data to make probabilistic assumptions. In fact, sometimes the only information available to the analyst is in the form of upper and lower bounds of the data. In such cases, interval analysis (IA) offers an alternative to quantify the uncertainty. Another difficulty is that we generally do not have direct access to the value of an uncertain mechanical quantity but only to indirect measurements or models that are used to represent it [1]. Indeed, the data uncertainty that flows through the model cascade can arise from measurements or from predictions of other models. To solve these problems, we present a novel interval deep neural network (DINN) that is capable of providing reliable input data to a mechanics model from data containing uncertainty. A numerical experiment is conducted using a dataset of concrete mix measurements with interval uncertainty to predict concrete strength. In general, the DINN can be used to solve multiple problems under uncertainty in science and engineering. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Deep neural networks; Interval analysis; Interval uncertainty; Machine learning","Computational mechanics; Computational methods; Concrete mixtures; Data handling; Deep neural networks; Safety engineering; Uncertainty analysis; Complex engineering system; Computational modelling; Data uncertainty; Input uncertainty; Interval analysis; Interval uncertainty; Machine-learning; Sub-problems; Uncertainty; Use-model; Forecasting","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

At the core of the model was a flexible and agent-specific association between acoustic exemplars and phonological categories. This was achieved by means of two general-purpose unsupervised machine learning algorithms: the first grouped exemplars into acoustic clusters, the second identified sets of clusters which largely contain exemplars of the same word classes. The model was tested first on data from Standard Southern British English, where a shift of /u/ to the front of the vowel space was expected not to cause any phonological re-categorisation. The simulation indeed showed phonological stability despite the phonetic change. Using the same settings, the ABM was then applied to data from New Zealand English in which a merger of /eə, ɪə/ diphthongs has taken place in the last 50 years. Compatibly with that, the simulation showed a shift from /eə/ towards /ɪə/ along with the neutralisation of the diphthong contrast.

The authors herein evaluated the performance of a newly developed convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and analyze intracranial aneurysms (IAs) on CTA. METHODS: Consecutive patients with CTA studies between January 2015 and July 2021 at a single center were identified. The ground truth determination of cerebral aneurysm presence or absence was made from the neuroradiology report. The primary outcome was the performance of the CNN in detecting IAs in an external validation set, measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistics. Secondary outcomes included accuracy for location and size measurement. RESULTS: The independent validation imaging data set consisted of 400 patients with CTA studies, median age 40 years (IQR 34 years) and 141 (35.3%) of whom were male; 193 patients (48.3%) had a diagnosis of IA on neuroradiologist evaluation. The median maximum IA diameter was 3.7 mm (IQR 2.5 mm). In the independent validation imaging data set, the CNN performed well with 93.8% sensitivity (95% CI 0.87-0.98), 94.2% specificity (95% CI 0.90-0.97), and a positive predictive value of 88.2% (95% CI 0.80-0.94) in the subgroup with an IA diameter ≥ 4 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The described Viz.ai Aneurysm CNN performed well in identifying the presence or absence of IAs in an independent validation imaging set. Further studies are necessary to investigate the impact of the software on detection rates in a real-world setting.","artificial intelligence; cerebral aneurysm; CT angiography; diagnostic technique; endovascular neurosurgery; technology; vascular disorders","Adult; Algorithms; Female; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Machine Learning; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; adult; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; female; human; intracranial aneurysm; machine learning; male; predictive value; retrospective study","","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Accurate rupture risk prediction can effectively aid treatment planning, but conventional rupture risk estimation based on clinical information is subjective and time-consuming. Methods: We propose a novel classification method based on the CTA images for differentiating aneurysms that are prone to rupture. The main contribution of this study is that the learning-based method proposed in this study leverages deep learning and radiomics features and integrates clinical information for a more accurate prediction of the risk of rupture. Specifically, we first extracted the provided aneurysm regions from the CTA images as 3D patches with the lesions located at their centers. Then, we employed an encoder using a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract complex latent features automatically. These features were then combined with radiomics features and clinical information. We further applied the LASSO regression method to find optimal features that are highly relevant to the rupture risk information, which is fed into a support vector machine (SVM) for final rupture risk prediction. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that our classification method can achieve accuracy and AUC scores of 89.78% and 89.09%, respectively, outperforming all the alternative methods. Discussion: Our study indicates that the incorporation of CNN and radiomics analysis can improve the prediction performance, and the selected optimal feature set can provide essential biomarkers for the determination of rupture risk, which is also of great clinical importance for individualized treatment planning and patient care of IA.

The construction of readmission prediction model can assist doctors in making decisions to prevent patients from deteriorating and reduce the cost burden. This paper extracts the patient discharge records from the MIMIC-III database. It divides the patients into three research categories: no readmission, readmission within 30 days, and readmission after 30 days, to predict the readmission of patients. We propose the HR-BGCN model to predict the readmission of patients. First, we use the Adaptive-TMix to improve the prediction indicators of a few categories and reduce the impact of unbalanced categories. Then, the knowledge-informed graph attention mechanism is proposed. By introducing a document-level explicit diagram structure, the coding ability of graph node features is significantly improved. The paragraph-level representation obtained through graph learning is combined with the context token-level representation of BERT, and finally, the multi-classification task is carried out. We also compare several typical graph learning classification models to verify the model's effectiveness, such as the IA-GCN model, GAT model, etc. The results show that the average F1 score of the HR-BGCN model proposed in this paper for 30-day readmission of heart failure patients is 88.26%, and the average accuracy is 90.47%. The HR-BGCN model is significantly better than the graph learning classification model for predicting heart failure readmission. It can help doctors predict the 30-day readmission of patients, then reduce the readmission rate of patients. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Clinical notes; Graph convolutional networks; Heart failure; MIMIC-III; Readmission prediction","Electronic Health Records; Heart Failure; Humans; Learning; Machine Learning; Patient Readmission; Cardiology; Heart; Learning systems; Classification models; Clinical notes; Convolutional networks; Electronic health; Graph convolutional network; Health records; Heart failure; High costs; MIMIC-III; Readmission prediction; accuracy; area under the curve; Article; classification; controlled study; cost; data analysis; electronic health record; heart failure; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; human; ICD-9; knowledge; major clinical study; model; prediction; public health problem; recall; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity analysis; heart failure; hospital readmission; learning; machine learning; Forecasting","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We employ the Research Institute of Highway Ministry of Transport track dataset to construct predictive models for pavement distress, comparing various methodologies including Random Forest (RF) regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) machines, Snake Optimizer-Random Forest (SO-RF), and Snake Optimizer-Extreme Gradient Boosting (SO-XGB). The approach is conducted by multiple experiments and a comprehensive comparative analysis leveraging the repeated K-Fold cross-validation method to ensure the robust assessment for these models. Our findings show that the SO-XGB method is particularly effective in predicting rutting depth. The strength of the SO-XGB model lies in its excellent performance in several performance metrics, such as coefficient of determination (R2), the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), performance index (PI), index of agreement (IA), variance accounted for (VAF) and objective function (OBJ). These results not only illustrate the model's accuracy but also the practical applicability of SO-XGB model in automatically forecasting pavement damage.

Nevertheless, it is still uncertain whether m6A methylation plays a role in the onset and progression of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). This study aimed to establish the function of m6A RNA methylation in IA, as well as its correlation with the immunological microenvironment. Methods: Our study included a total of 97 samples (64 IA, 33 normal) in the training set and 60 samples (44 IA, 16 normal) in the validation set to systematically assess the pattern of RNA modifications mediated by 22 m6A regulators. The effects of m6A modifications on immune microenvironment features, i.e., immune response gene sets, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, and infiltrating immune cells were explored. We employed Lasso, machine learning, and logistic regression for the purpose of identifying an m6A regulator gene signature of IA with external data validation. For the unsupervised clustering analysis of m6A modification patterns in IA, consensus clustering methods were employed. Enrichment analysis was used to assess immune response activity along with other functional pathways. The identification of m6A methylation markers was identified based on a protein–protein interaction network and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. Results: We identified an m6A regulator signature of IGFBP2, IGFBP1, IGF2BP2, YTHDF3, ALKBH5, RBM15B, LRPPRC, and ELAVL1, which could easily distinguish individuals with IA from healthy individuals. Unsupervised clustering revealed three m6A modification patterns. Gene enrichment analysis illustrated that the tight junction, p53 pathway, and NOTCH signaling pathway varied significantly in m6A modifier patterns. In addition, the three m6A modification patterns showed significant differences in m6A regulator expression, immune microenvironment, and bio-functional pathways. Furthermore, macrophages, activated T cells, and other immune cells were strongly correlated with m6A regulators. Eight m6A indicators were discovered—each with a statistically significant correlation with IA—suggesting their potential as prognostic biological markers. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that m6A RNA methylation and the immunological microenvironment are both intricately correlated with the onset and progression of IA. The novel insight into patterns of m6A modification offers a foundation for the development of innovative treatment approaches for IA.

Many soft computing techniques have been implemented for the prediction of water levels in lakes. While several deep learning models have been adopted, the comparison of the performance of these models with machine learning models is quite limited. In this study, the water level of Jezioro Kosno Lake in Poland has been predicted using 30 years of daily water level data through tree-based machine learning techniques, namely Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as deep learning techniques, namely bidirectional LSTM, convolutional 1D-BiLSTM, and recurrent neural network.

Present UAV powertrains are designed with internal combustion engines capable of combusting single fuel types, which have significant restrictions on fuel ignition quality. However, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) can exhibit wide variance in ignitability with cetane numbers (CNs) ranging from 15 to greater than 50. Coupled with high-speed and high-altitude engine operating conditions, low CN jet fuels can pose a serious challenge to achieving reliable, clean, and fuel-flexible ignition. Energy-Assisted Compression Ignition (EACI) has demonstrated superior ignition-controlling capability with jet fuels due to the precise thermal energy deposition achieved from the continuously operating high-temperature Ignition-Assistant (IA). However, the current literature highlights enhancement needs in the operational capabilities of EACI strategy with low CN jet fuels. Therefore, this paper aims to demonstrate improved EACI characteristics of low and varying ignition-quality SAF blends used in high-altitude aerial conditions through a combined computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and machine learning (ML)-based piston-bowl optimization methodology. In this work, a CFD-enabled Design-of-experiments approach, covering nine piston-bowl and three operational parameters, is used to develop a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)-based ML modeling routine. Further, a merit-function-driven piston-bowl optimization is performed using the GPR model for improved EACI operations with CN 30 SAF blend. The combined CFD and GPR methodology helped screen more than 20 million piston designs to find the optimum. The study found that the piston optimization allowed consistent improvements in EACI operability for CN 30 to CN 48 jet fuels with maximum reductions in ignition delays of 17% and CA50 (50% mass-burn fraction crank angle) of 22% for CN 30 SAF blend compared to the stock piston. The optimized piston-bowl also helped reduce IA input power requirements by 20–28%, thus improving the reliability and capabilities of EACI to achieve multi-jet fuel operation. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Computational fluid dynamics; Energy-assisted compression ignition; Machine learning; Optical & metal engine experiments; Piston optimization; Sustainable aviation fuel blends","Antennas; Computational fluid dynamics; Design of experiments; Engines; Ignition; Jet fuel; Kinetics; Machine learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aviation fuel; Compression ignition; Energy; Energy-assisted compression ignition; Fuel blends; Machine-learning; Optical & metal engine experiment; Optical-; Optimisations; Piston optimization; Sustainable aviation fuel blend; Pistons","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

The learning process of the model is performed by conducting a combination of backpropagation gradient descent and least-squares techniques. The performance of the model is examined by several quality metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE), Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE), Index of Agreement (IA) and Slope of linear regression. Monte Carlo random sampling technique is employed to propagate input variations to the output response. Moreover, the performance of ANFIS is also compared with other machine learning models including Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Ensemble. Results show that the ANFIS model yields higher prediction performance than other machine learning models, for both training and testing data points and regarding all quality metrics. For instance, using training data points, the ANFIS model exhibits a RMSE of 0.0283 compared to 0.0342, 0.0588, 0.0291, and 0.0464 using ANN, Ensemble, GPR, and SVM, respectively (the corresponding gain values are+17.3%,+51.9%,+2.8%, and+39.0%, respectively).

Prediction of crash risk is vital for avoiding secondary crashes and safeguarding highway traffic. For many years, researchers have explored several techniques for early and precise detection of crashes to aid in traffic incident management. With recent advancements in data collection techniques, abundant real-time traffic data is available for use. Big data infrastructure and machine learning algorithms can utilize this data to provide suitable solutions for the highway traffic safety system. This paper explores the feasibility of using deep learning models to detect crash occurrence and predict crash risk. Volume, Speed and Sensor Occupancy data collected from roadside radar sensors along Interstate 235 in Des Moines, IA is used for this study. This real-world traffic data is used to design feature set for the deep learning models for crash detection and crash risk prediction. The results show that a deep model has better crash detection performance and similar crash prediction performance than state of the art shallow models. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for crash risk prediction using data 1-minute, 5-minutes and 10-minutes prior to crash occurrence. It was observed that is hard to predict the crash risk of a traffic condition, 10 min prior to a crash. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crash detection; Crash prediction; Deep learning","Accidents, Traffic; Data Collection; Deep Learning; Humans; Logistic Models; Risk Assessment; Forecasting; Highway accidents; Highway administration; Highway traffic control; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Crash prediction; Data infrastructure; Detection performance; Real-time traffic datum; Suitable solutions; Traffic conditions; Traffic incidents; Traffic management centers; human; information processing; prevention and control; procedures; risk assessment; statistical model; traffic accident; Deep learning","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

This is a challenging problem with significant potential applications such as in security (intrusion detection) or compiler optimisation (profiling). To represent behaviour we use game semantics, a powerful method of semantic analysis for programming languages. It gives mathematically accurate models (‘fully abstract’) for a wide variety of programming languages. Game-semantic models are combinatorial characterisations of all possible interactions between a term and its syntactic context. Because such interactions can be concretely represented as sets of sequences, it is possible to ask whether they can be learned from examples. Concretely, we are using LSTM, a technique which proved effective in learning natural languages for automatic translation and text synthesis, to learn game-semantic models of sequential and concurrent versions of Idealised Algol (IA), which are algorithmically complex yet can be concisely described. We will measure how accurate the learned models are as a function of the degree of the term and the number of free variables involved. Finally, we will show how to use the learned model to perform latent semantic analysis between concurrent and sequential Idealised Algol. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Game semantics; Machine learning; Programming language semantics; Recurrent neural networks","Abstracting; ALGOL (programming language); Intrusion detection; Learning systems; Object oriented programming; Recurrent neural networks; Semantics; Automatic translation; Free variable; Game semantics; Latent Semantic Analysis; Natural languages; Optimisations; Programming language semantics; Semantic analysis; Long short-term memory","Elsevier Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We aimed to develop a computer-assisted detection system for small-sized aneurysm ruptures using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on images of three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography. A retrospective data set, including 368 patients, was used as a training cohort for the CNN using the TensorFlow platform. Aneurysm images in six directions were obtained from each patient and the region-of-interest in each image was extracted. The resulting CNN was prospectively tested in 272 patients and the sensitivity, specificity, overall accuracy, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) were compared to a human evaluator. Our system showed a sensitivity of 78.76% (95% CI: 72.30%–84.30%), a specificity of 72.15% (95% CI: 60.93%–81.65%), and an overall diagnostic accuracy of 76.84% (95% CI: 71.36%–81.72%) in aneurysm rupture predictions. The area under the ROC (AUROC) in the CNN was 0.755 (95% CI: 0.699%–0.805%), better than that obtained from a human evaluator (AUROC: 0.537; p < 0.001). The CNN-based prediction system was feasible to assess rupture risk in small-sized aneurysms with diagnostic accuracy superior to human evaluators. Additional studies based on a large data set are necessary to enhance diagnostic accuracy and to facilitate clinical application. © 2019 by the authors.

A case-control study was conducted to explore the application and clinical value of machine learning-based cervical cancer (CC) diagnosis and prediction model in adjuvant chemotherapy of CC. Methods. From August 2019 to August 2021, 46 patients with stage IA CC (study group) and 55 patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) (control group) were retrospectively analyzed. All patients completed routine MRI examinations, the ADC values of diseased CC and normal cervix and cervical tissues in different stages were compared, and the changes of ADC values in CC tissues before and after chemotherapy were analyzed. The training set (IA = 37, HSIL = 44) and test set (IA = 9, HSIL = 11) are set in a ratio of 4: 1. The preoperative MRI images were collected and uploaded to the radiomics cloud platform after preprocessing, and the cervix was manually delineated layer by layer on OSag-T2WI, OAx-T1WI, and OAx-T2FS, respectively, to obtain a three-dimensional volume of interest (VOI) of the cervix to extract omics features. Variance Threshold analysis, univariate feature selection (SelectKBest), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) are adopted to reduce the dimension of data and enroll features. The arbitrary forest model was adopted for machine learning, the ROC curve was drawn, and the diagnostic performance of different sequence omics models was analyzed. Results. Compared with ADC of stage A CC and HSIL, the ADC value of CC was remarkably lower than that of normal CC (P<0.05). The ROC curve analysis of ADC value to differentiate CC and normal cervix indicated that the AUC was 0.838 and the 95% confidence interval was 0.721-0.955. According to the maximum Youden index of 0.848, the optimal critical value of ADC was 1.267 × 10-3 mm2/s and the sensitivity and specificity were 92.21% and 9.48%, respectively. All results are indicated in Table 2. After CC treatment, 12 patients were effective (CR + PR) and 4 patients were ineffective (PD + SD). When the b value was 1000 s/mm2, the ADC value of the effective patients after the second chemotherapy was significantly higher than that of the first chemotherapy and before treatment (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the ADC value after the first chemotherapy and before treatment, compared with before treatment (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in ADC value between the ineffective patients before treatment and after the first and second chemotherapy (P>0.05). A total of 8 omics features were extracted based on OSag-T2WI, all of which were wavelet features, including 7 texture features and 1 first-order feature. A total of 10 omics features were extracted based on OAx-T1WI, including 6 wavelet first-order features, 2 gradient first-order features, and 2 wavelet texture features. Based on OAx-T2FS, 6 omics features were extracted, including 3 wavelet texture features, 2 original shape features, and 1 logarithmic first-order feature. Based on OSag-T2WI&OAx-T2FS, 9 histological features were extracted, 4 from OSag-T2WI and 5 from OAx-T2FS. The diagnostic performance of the four arbitrary forest models is indicated in Table 1, and the ROC curve is indicated in Figure 6. The diagnostic performance of the omics model based on OSag-T2WI&OAx-T2FS was the best in both the training set and the test set. The AUC of the training set was 0.991 (95% CI (0.94, 1.00)), and the accuracy rate was 0.925. The AUC of the test set was 0.894 (95% CI (0.75, 1.00)), and the accuracy rate was 0.835. On the other hand, the diagnostic efficiency of the group model based on OAx-T1WI was the worst in both the training set and the test set. The AUC of the training set was 0.713 (95% CI (0.52, 0.92)), and the accuracy rate was 0.71. The AUC of test set is 0.513 (95% CI (0.24, 0.77)), and the accuracy rate was 0.56, which has no practical clinical significance. Conclusion. A CC diagnosis and prediction model based on machine learning can better distinguish stage IA CC from HSIL in the absence of clear lesions, which is of great significance for reducing invasive examination before surgery, guiding surgical procedures and adjuvant chemotherapy for CC. © 2022 Yang Wang et al.","","Case-Control Studies; Cervix Uteri; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Retrospective Studies; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms; cisplatin; adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; case control study; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; human; human tissue; hysterectomy; image processing; image segmentation; imaging algorithm; least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; machine learning; major clinical study; mathematical model; microscopy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; random forest; retrospective study; squamous intraepithelial lesion of the cervix; uterine cervix cancer; Youden index; adjuvant chemotherapy; diagnostic imaging; machine learning; uterine cervix; uterine cervix tumor","Hindawi Limited","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Methods: Patients with stage IA to IV NSCLC were included, and the whole dataset was divided into training and testing sets and an external validation set. To tackle imbalanced datasets in NSCLC, we generated a new dataset and achieved equilibrium of class distribution by using SMOTE algorithm. The datasets were randomly split up into a training/testing set. We calculated the importance value of CT image features by means of mean decrease gini impurity generated by random forest algorithm and selected optimal features according to feature importance (mean decrease gini impurity > 0.005). The performance of prediction model in training and testing sets were evaluated from the perspectives of classification accuracy, average precision (AP) score and precision-recall curve. The predictive accuracy of the model was externally validated using lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) samples from TCGA database. Results: The prediction model that incorporated nine image features exhibited a high classification accuracy, precision and recall scores in the training and testing sets. In the external validation, the predictive accuracy of the model in LUAD outperformed that in LUSC. Conclusions: The pathologic stage of patients with NSCLC can be accurately predicted based on CT image features, especially for LUAD. Our findings extend the application of machine learning algorithms in CT image feature prediction for pathologic staging and identify potential imaging biomarkers that can be used for diagnosis of pathologic stage in NSCLC patients. © 2019 The Author(s).","Computed tomography (CT); Machine learning algorithm; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); Radiomics","Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lung Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Male; Neoplasm Staging; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; adult; algorithm; Article; cancer classification; cancer staging; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; disease marker; false positive result; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; image analysis; lung adenocarcinoma; machine learning; major clinical study; male; measurement precision; non small cell lung cancer; prediction; radiological parameters; random forest; squamous cell lung carcinoma; training; validation study; x-ray computed tomography; cancer staging; classification; computer assisted diagnosis; lung tumor; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; procedures; x-ray computed tomography","BioMed Central Ltd.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

New approaches for risk stratification beyond tumor stage are needed. Gene expression-based AC subtypes such as the Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA) terminal-respiratory unit (TRU), proximal-inflammatory (PI) and proximal-proliferative (PP) subtypes have been associated with prognosis, but show methodological limitations for robust clinical use. We aimed to derive a platform independent single sample predictor (SSP) for molecular subtype assignment and risk stratification that could function in a clinical setting. Two-class (TRU/nonTRU=SSP2) and three-class (TRU/PP/PI=SSP3) SSPs using the AIMS algorithm were trained in 1655 ACs (n = 9659 genes) from public repositories vs TCGA centroid subtypes. Validation and survival analysis were performed in 977 patients using overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) as endpoints. In the validation cohort, SSP2 and SSP3 showed accuracies of 0.85 and 0.81, respectively. SSPs captured relevant biology previously associated with the TCGA subtypes and were associated with prognosis. In survival analysis, OS and DMFS for cases discordantly classified between TCGA and SSP2 favored the SSP2 classification. In resected Stage I patients, SSP2 identified TRU-cases with better OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18-0.49) and DMFS (TRU HR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.33-0.83) independent of age, Stage IA/IB and gender. SSP2 was transformed into a NanoString nCounter assay and tested in 44 Stage I patients using RNA from formalin-fixed tissue, providing prognostic stratification (relapse-free interval, HR = 3.2; 95% CI = 1.2-8.8). In conclusion, gene expression-based SSPs can provide molecular subtype and independent prognostic information in early-stage lung ACs. SSPs may overcome critical limitations in the applicability of gene signatures in lung cancer. © 2020 The Authors.

We previously found significant RNA expression differences in circulating neutrophils between patients with and without unruptured IAs and trained machine learning models to predict presence of IA using 40 neutrophil transcriptomes. Here, we aim to develop a predictive model for unruptured IA using neutrophil transcriptomes from a larger population and more robust machine learning methods. Methods: Neutrophil RNA extracted from the blood of 134 patients (55 with IA, 79 IA-free controls) was subjected to next-generation RNA sequencing. In a randomly-selected training cohort (n = 94), the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) selected transcripts, from which we constructed prediction models via 4 well-established supervised machine-learning algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines with Gaussian and cubic kernels). We tested the models in the remaining samples (n = 40) and assessed model performance by receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of 9 IA-associated genes was used to verify gene expression in a subset of 49 neutrophil RNA samples. We also examined the potential influence of demographics and comorbidities on model prediction. Results: Feature selection using LASSO in the training cohort identified 37 IA-associated transcripts. Models trained using these transcripts had a maximum accuracy of 90% in the testing cohort. The testing performance across all methods had an average area under ROC curve (AUC) = 0.97, an improvement over our previous models. The Random Forest model performed best across both training and testing cohorts. RT-qPCR confirmed expression differences in 7 of 9 genes tested. Gene ontology and IPA network analyses performed on the 37 model genes reflected dysregulated inflammation, cell signaling, and apoptosis processes. In our data, demographics and comorbidities did not affect model performance. Conclusions: We improved upon our previous IA prediction models based on circulating neutrophil transcriptomes by increasing sample size and by implementing LASSO and more robust machine learning methods. Future studies are needed to validate these models in larger cohorts and further investigate effect of covariates. © 2020, The Author(s).","Inflammation; Intracranial aneurysm; Machine learning; Neutrophil; Prediction model; Transcriptomics","Cohort Studies; Gene Ontology; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Neutrophils; ROC Curve; RNA; adult; apoptosis; arthritis; Article; cerebrovascular accident; cholesterol diet; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; cubic kernel; demography; diabetes mellitus; disease association; female; gene expression; genetic association; genetic model; heart disease; high throughput sequencing; human; hypertension; k nearest neighbor; kernel method; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neutrophil; pathogenesis; prediction; quantitative analysis; random forest; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA sequencing; signal transduction; support vector machine; transcriptomics; unruptured intracranial aneurysm; gene ontology; genetics; intracranial aneurysm; neutrophil; receiver operating characteristic","BioMed Central Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is challenging to identify an ML model that has the outperformance in all scenarios. Therefore, there are a number of aggregation strategies developed to improve STLF. However, the superiority of these aggregation strategies has not been assessed. In this paper, STLF with three aggregation strategies are developed, which are information aggregation (IA), model aggregation (MA), and hierarchy aggregation (HA). The IA, MA, and HA strategies aggregate inputs, models, and forecasts at the pre-forecasting, model-building, or post-forecasting stage, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the three aggregation strategies, a set of 10 models based on 4 machine-learning algorithms are developed in each aggregation category to predict 1-hour-ahead load. Case studies show that: (i) STLF-IA presents superior performance than STLF with weather data and STLF with individual load data consistently, and the performance can be further enhanced by the recursive feature elemination (RFE) feature selection method; (ii) MA improves the STLF robustness by reducing the risk of unsatisfactory single-algorithm STLF models; and (iii) STLF-HA produces the most accurate forecasts with a 0.83% normalized mean absolute error and a 1.35% mean absolute percentage error, while keeping hierarchical aggregate consistency. © 2020","Aggregate forecasting; Ensemble forecasting; Hierarchical forecasting; Load forecasting; Machine learning","Aggregates; Electric power plant loads; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Aggregation strategy; Ensemble forecasting; Feature selection methods; Information aggregation; Load forecasting; Mean absolute percentage error; Power system operations; Short term load forecasting; Machine learning","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

However, there is little discussion about the accuracy and reliability of such technology, which has been used in situations where human life depends on its decision-making process, which is the result of its training, one of the stages of development. It is known that the learning process of an Artificial Intelligence, which can use the Artificial Neural Networks technology, presents an error of the predicted value in relation to the real value, which can compromise its application, being more critical in situations where the user's security is a major issue. In this article, we discuss the main technologies used in AI, their development history, considerations about Artificial Neural Networks and the failures arising from the training and hardware processes used. Three types of errors are discussed: The Adversarial Examples, the Soft Errors and the Errors due the lack of Appropriate Training. A case study associated with the third type of error is discussed and actions based on Design of Experiments are proposed.

Algorithms such as artificial neural networks or support vector machines for regression (SVRs) have been proposed for the design of large reflectarrays for space applications at a single frequency. However, multifrequency optimization of such large antennas has not been tackled with MLTs. In this letter, for the first time, we propose a technique based on the use of SVR analysis to obtain the reflection coefficients to accelerate the design of a very large shaped-beam reflectarray for direct broadcast satellite in a 15% bandwidth. An in-house method of moments based on local periodicity is employed to generate samples to train the SVRs for each considered frequency. Then, the surrogate model is used for a design at central frequency, which is used as starting point for a wideband design procedure that is accelerated more than an order of magnitude without a significant loss of accuracy. It is shown that, by the virtue of the proposed methodology, the minimum copolar gain in the coverage zone is improved more than 10 dB at the upper frequency while maintaining a computationally efficient design procedure. © 2002-2011 IEEE.","Direct broadcast satellite (DBS); Generalized intersection approach (IA); Machine learning; Shaped-beam; Support vector regression (SVR); Wideband reflectarray antenna","Antenna arrays; Broadcasting; Electromagnets; Learning systems; Machine learning; Method of moments; Neural networks; Regression analysis; Space applications; Support vector machines; Vector spaces; Direct broadcast satellites; Generalized intersection; Reflectarray antennas; Shaped beam; Support vector regression (SVR); Optical design","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

In our analysis, two non-linear interpolating tools are used to reconstruct the Hubble parameter, one is the artificial neural network (ANN) method, and the other is the Gaussian process (GP) method. We find that ωK based on the GP method can be greatly influenced by the prior of H0, while the ANN method can overcome this. Therefore, the ANN method may have more advantages than GP in the measurement of the cosmic curvature. Based on the ANN method, we find a spatially open universe is preferred by the current H(z) and SNe Ia data, and the difference between our result and the value inferred from Planck cosmic microwave background is 1.6σ. In order to test the reliability of the ANN method, and the potentiality of the future gravitational waves (GW) standard sirens in the measurement of the cosmic curvature, we constrain ωK using the simulated Hubble parameter and GW standard sirens in a model-independent way. We find that the ANN method is reliable and unbiased, and the error of ωK is ∼0.186 when 100 GW events with electromagnetic counterparts are detected, which is \sim 56{{\ \rm per\ cent}} smaller than that constrained from the Pantheon SNe Ia. Therefore, the data-driven method based on ANN has potential in the measurement of the cosmic curvature.  © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","cosmological parameters; cosmology: observations; methods: data analysis","Cosmology; Machine learning; Neural networks; Parameter estimation; Supernovae; Artificial neural network methods; Cosmics; Cosmological parameters; Cosmology observations; Gaussian Processes; Gravitational-waves; Hubble's parameters; Measurements of; Methods.

The FA functions as an optimizer tool in constructing the integrative models. Data for assessing these models was gathered from published literatures and field experiments conducted on researching farm at SBUK University, Kerman, Iran. The input parameters used in modeling were furrow length (L), the inflow rate (Q), advance time at the end of the furrow (TL), cross-sectional area of inflow (Ao) and infiltration opportunity time (To). The root mean square (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the correlation coefficient (R2), the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency index (NSE), and the index of agreement (IA) were used to evaluate the predicting performance of the suggested models. The best values of the statistical criteria and in training and testing phase of the simulation imply that the MLPNN-FA and SVR-FA provided an excellent fit to the observed data. Comparison of the results revealed that the FA is able to boost the accuracy of the models so that the improvement in RMSE values was 5%, 1%, 4%, 47% in the ANFIS, GMDH, MLPNN, and SVR, respectively. Having the calculated value for the comprehensive synthesis index (SI) indicated that using the combination of the SVR and FA noticeably enhance the performance of the standard SVR model by 97%.

How-ever, the procedure is associated with significant morbidities resulting from the removal of the parametrium. Parametrial cancer invasion (PMI) is found in a minority of patients but the efficient system used to predict it is lacking. In this study, we develop a novel machine learning (ML)-based predictive model based on a random forest model (called iPMI) for the practical identification of PMI in women. Data of 1112 stage IA-IIA cervical cancer patients who underwent primary surgery were collected and considered as the training dataset, while data from an independent cohort of 116 consec-utive patients were used as the independent test dataset. Based on these datasets, iPMI-Econ was then developed by using basic clinicopathological data available prior to surgery, while iPMI-Power was also introduced by adding pelvic node metastasis and uterine corpus invasion to the iPMI-Econ. Both 10-fold cross-validations and independent test results showed that iPMI-Power outperformed other well-known ML classifiers (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, multi-layer perceptron, naive Bayes, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting). Upon comparison, it was found that iPMI-Power was effective and had a superior performance to other well-known ML classifiers in predicting PMI. It is anticipated that the proposed iPMI may serve as a cost-effective and rapid approach to guide important clinical decision-making. © 2021 by the authors.

In data mining algorithms, imbalanced data is a profound problem in machine learning paradigm. It appears due to desperate nature of data in which, one class with a large number of instances presents the majority class, while the other class with only a few instances is known as minority class. The classifier model biases towards the majority class and neglects the minority class which may happen to be the most essential class; resulting into costly misclassification error of minority class in real-world scenarios. Imbalanced data problem is significantly overcome by using re-sampling techniques, in which oversampling techniques are proven to be more effective than undersampling. This study proposes an Improved Adaptive Semi Unsupervised Weighted Oversampling (IA-SUWO) technique with sparsity factor, which efficiently solves between-the-class and within-the-class imbalances problem. Along with avoiding over-generalization, overfitting problems and removing noise from the data, this technique enhances the number of synthetic instances in the minority sub-clusters appropriately. A comprehensive experimental setup is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The comparative analysis reveals that the IA-SUWO performs better than the existing baseline oversampling techniques. © 2019, Science and Information Organization.","Data mining; Imbalanced data; Majority; Minority; Oversampling","Machine learning; Classifier models; Data mining algorithm; Data volume; Imbalanced data; Imbalanced dataset; Majority; Minority; Model bias; Over sampling; Oversampling technique; Data mining","Science and Information Organization","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Methods: Data were collected from the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2014. Based on demographic and surgical characteristics, a novel 10-year survival prognostic scoring system was developed using Cox regression. Results: There were 2041 eligible patients with stage I mucinous ovarian cancer including 1362 (67%) with stage IA/IB disease, 598 (29%) with stage IC disease, and 81 (4%) with stage I disease not otherwise specified. Median age was 52 with a range of 13–90 years old. 737 (36%) patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was more common in patients with stage IC relative to stage IA/IB disease (69% vs. 21%, P < 0.001) or with poorly-differentiated relative to well-differentiated tumors (69% vs. 23%, P < 0.001). Unadjusted 10-year survival was 81% relative to 79% for patients treated with vs. without chemotherapy, respectively (P = 0.46). Patients were predicted to exhibit a low- or a high-risk of death using a multivariate Cox regression model with age, stage, grade, lymphovascular space invasion and ascites. Risk of death without vs. with adjuvant chemotherapy was similar in low-risk patients (88% vs. 84%; HR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.56–1.15, P = 0.23) and worse in high-risk patients (51% vs. 74%; HR = 1.58, 95%CI: 1.05–2.38, P = 0.03) with stage I mucinous ovarian cancer. Conclusions: A predictive scoring algorithm may provide prognostic information on long-term survival and identify high-risk stage I mucinous ovarian cancer patients who might achieve a survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Chemotherapy; Clinical calculator; Mucinous ovarian cancer","Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Clinical Decision-Making; Decision Support Techniques; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Nomograms; Ovarian Neoplasms; Ovary; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Salpingo-oophorectomy; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; United States; Young Adult; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic agent; adjuvant chemotherapy; adolescent; adult; African American; aged; Alaska Native; American Indian; Article; Asian; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer survival; Caucasian; Charlson Comorbidity Index; clinical feature; cohort analysis; female; high risk patient; human; hysterectomy; long term survival; low risk patient; lymph node dissection; lymph vessel metastasis; machine learning; major clinical study; malignant ascites; observational study; omentectomy; ovary cancer; overall survival; Pacific Islander; priority journal; retrospective study; salpingooophorectomy; adjuvant chemotherapy; algorithm; clinical decision making; colloid carcinoma; decision support system; epidemiology; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; mortality; nomogram; ovary; ovary tumor; pathology; procedures; register; risk assessment; surgery; survival rate; treatment outcome; United States; very elderly; young adult","Academic Press Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Only the use of the machine learning algorithms can process such large data volumes. Most of the discovered transients will belong to the known classes of astronomical objects. However, it is expected that some transients will be rare or completely new events of unknown physical nature. The task of finding them can be framed as an anomaly detection problem. In this work, we perform for the first time an automated anomaly detection analysis in the photometric data of the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), which serves as a proof of concept for the applicability of thesemethods to future largescale surveys. The analysis consists of the following steps: (1) data selection from the OSC and approximation of the pre-processed data with Gaussian processes, (2) dimensionality reduction, (3) searching for outliers with the use of the isolation forest algorithm, and (4) expert analysis of the identified outliers. The pipeline returned 81 candidate anomalies, 27 (33 per cent) of which were confirmed to be from astrophysically peculiar objects. Found anomalies correspond to a selected sample of 1.4 per cent of the initial automatically identified data sample of approximately 2000 objects. Among the identified outliers we recognized superluminous supernovae, non-classical Type Ia supernovae, unusual Type II supernovae, one active galactic nucleus and one binary microlensing event. We also found that 16 anomalies classified as supernovae in the literature are likely to be quasars or stars. Our proposed pipeline represents an effective strategy to guarantee we shall not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we fought so hard to acquire.

Methods: This multicenter study cohort of 623 lung adenocarcinomas was split into training (n = 331), testing (n = 143), and external validation dataset (n = 149). Random forest models were built using selected radiomics features, results from FS, lesion volume, clinical and semantic features, and combinations thereof. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) was used to evaluate model performances. The diagnosis accuracy, calibration, and decision curves of models were tested. Results: The radiomics-based model shows good predictive performance and diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing IA from PM, with AUCs of 0.89, 0.89, and 0.88, in the training, testing, and validation datasets, respectively, and with corresponding accuracies of 0.82, 0.79, and 0.85. Adding lesion volume and FS significantly increases the performance of the model with AUCs of 0.96, 0.97, and 0.96, and with accuracies of 0.91, 0.94, and 0.93 in the three datasets. There is no significant difference in AUC between the FS model enriched with radiomics and volume against an FS model enriched with volume alone, while the former has higher accuracy. The model combining all available information shows minor non-significant improvements in AUC and accuracy compared with an FS model enriched with radiomics and volume. Conclusions: Radiomics signatures are potential biomarkers for the risk of IA, especially in combination with FS, and could help guide surgical strategy for pulmonary nodules patients. Key Points: • A CT-based radiomics model may be a valuable tool for preoperative prediction of invasive adenocarcinoma for patients with pulmonary nodules. • Radiomics combined with frozen sections could help in guiding surgery strategy for patients with pulmonary nodules. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adenocarcinoma of lung; Carcinoma, non-small-cell lung; Frozen sections; Machine learning; Tomography, spiral computed","Adenocarcinoma in Situ; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Area Under Curve; Female; Frozen Sections; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Pulmonary Nodules; Preoperative Care; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Solitary Pulmonary Nodule; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; adenocarcinoma in situ; adult; Article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; diagnostic accuracy; feature selection; female; frozen section; human; image segmentation; intraoperative period; lesion volume; lung adenocarcinoma; lung nodule; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; multicenter study; preoperative period; priority journal; radiomics; random forest; retrospective study; semantics; tumor invasion; x-ray computed tomography; adenocarcinoma in situ; area under the curve; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; frozen section; lung adenocarcinoma; lung nodule; lung tumor; multiple pulmonary nodules; pathology; preoperative care; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; x-ray computed tomography","Springer","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

In this study, four machine learning methods, ground-based LiDAR data and meteorological data were used to predict the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. Among the four methods, the random forest (RF) method was the most effective in predicting ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. Compared with BP neural network, support vector machine (SVM), and various linear fitting methods, the accuracy of the RF method was superior by 10%. The method can describe the spatial and temporal variation in PM2.5 concentrations under different meteorological conditions, with low root mean square error (RMSE) and mean square deviation (MD), and the consistency index (IA) reached 99.69%. Under different weather conditions, the hourly variation in PM2.5 concentrations has a good descriptive ability. In this paper, we analyzed the weights of input variables in the RF method, constructed a pollution case to correspond to the relationship between input variables and PM2.5, and analyzed the sources of pollutants via HYSPLIT backward trajectory. This method can study the interaction between PM2.5 and air pollution variables, and provide new ideas for preventing and forecasting air pollution. © 2021. The Author(s).

Strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) are an independent and direct way to measure H0, where a time-delay measurement between the multiple supernova (SN) images is required. In this work, we present two machine learning approaches for measuring time delays in LSNe Ia, namely, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) and a random forest (RF). For the training of the FCNN and the RF, we simulate mock LSNe Ia from theoretical SN Ia models that include observational noise and microlensing. We test the generalizability of the machine learning models by using a final test set based on empirical LSN Ia light curves not used in the training process, and we find that only the RF provides a low enough bias to achieve precision cosmology; as such, RF is therefore preferred over our FCNN approach for applications to real systems. For the RF with single-band photometry in the i band, we obtain an accuracy better than 1% in all investigated cases for time delays longer than 15 days, assuming follow-up observations with a 5σ point-source depth of 24.7, a two day cadence with a few random gaps, and a detection of the LSNe Ia 8 to 10 days before peak in the observer frame. In terms of precision, we can achieve an approximately 1.5-day uncertainty for a typical source redshift of ∼0.8 on the i band under the same assumptions. To improve the measurement, we find that using three bands, where we train a RF for each band separately and combine them afterward, helps to reduce the uncertainty to ∼1.0 day. The dominant source of uncertainty is the observational noise, and therefore the depth is an especially important factor when follow-up observations are triggered. We have publicly released the microlensed spectra and light curves used in this work.  © S.

However, the high structural conservation among the PI3K family makes it a big challenge to develop selective PI3Kγ inhibitors. Objectives: A novel machine learning-based virtual screening with multiple PI3Kγ protein structures was developed to discover novel PI3Kγ inhibitors. Methods: A large chemical database was screened using the virtual screening model, the top-ranked compounds were then subjected to a series of bio-evaluations, which led to the discovery of JN-KI3. The selective inhibition mechanism of JN-KI3 against PI3Kγ was uncovered by a theoretical study. Results: 49 hits were identified through virtual screening, and the cell-free enzymatic studies found that JN-KI3 selectively inhibited PI3Kγ at a concentration as low as 3,873 nM but had no inhibitory effect on Class IA PI3Ks, leading to the selective cytotoxicity on hematologic cancer cells. Meanwhile, JN-KI3 potently blocked the PI3K signaling, finally led to distinct apoptosis of hematologic cell lines at a low concentration. Lastly, the key residues of PI3Kγ and the structural characteristics of JN-KI3, which both would influence γ isoform-selective inhibition, were highlighted by systematic theoretical studies. Conclusion: The developed virtual screening model strongly manifests the robustness to find novel PI3Kγ inhibitors. JN-KI3 displays a specific cytotoxicity on hematologic tumor cells, and significantly promotes apoptosis associated with the inhibition of the PI3K signaling, which depicts PI3Kγ as a potential target for the hematologic tumor therapy.

Please verify. networks are envisioned to support large-scale sensing and distributed machine learning, thereby enabling new intelligent mobile applications. One common network operation will be the aggregation of distributed data (such as sensor observations or AI-model updates) for functional computation (e.g., averaging) so as to support large-scale sensing and distributed machine learning. An efficient solution for data aggregation, called over-the-air computation (AirComp), embeds functional computation into simultaneous access by many edge devices. Such schemes exploit the waveform superposition of a multi-access channel to allow an access point to receive a desired function of simultaneous signals. In this letter, we aim at realizing AirComp in a two-cell multi-antenna system. To this end, a novel scheme of simultaneous signal-and-interference alignment (SIA) is proposed that builds on classic IA to manage interference for multi-cell AirComp. The principle of SIA is to divide the spatial channel space into two subspaces with equal dimensions: one for signal alignment required by AirComp and the other for inter-cell IA. As a result, the number of interference-free spatially multiplexed functional streams received by each AP is maximized (equal to half of the available spatial degrees-of-freedom). Furthermore, the number is independent of the population of devices in each cell. In addition, the extension to SIA for more than two cells is discussed.  © 2012 IEEE.","interference channels; Multiple access interference; uplink","Alignment; Antennas; Cells; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Machine learning; Signal interference; Students; Distributed machine learning; Interference alignment; Interference-free; Mobile applications; Multi access channel; Multi-antenna systems; Simultaneous access; Waveform superposition; Cytology","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We assume that the dose–toxicity curve is monotonic non-decreasing and the dose–efficacy curve is unimodal. In the phase Ia stage, a Bayesian model on the toxicity rates is used to locate the maximum tolerated dose. In the phase Ib stage, we model the dose–efficacy curve using a step function while continuing to monitor the toxicity rates. Furthermore, a measure of the goodness of fit of a candidate step function is proposed, and the interval of BEDs associated with the best fitting step function is recommended. At the end of phase Ib, if some doses are recommended as BEDs, a cohort of confirmation is recruited and assigned at these doses to improve the precision of estimates at these doses.

We sought to develop an artificial intelligent (AI) algorithm for invasiveness assessment of lung adenocarcinoma manifesting as radiological SSNs. We investigated the performance of this algorithm in classification of SSNs related to invasiveness. Methods: A retrospective chest computed tomography (CT) dataset of 1,589 SSNs was constructed to develop (85%) and internally test (15%) the proposed AI diagnostic tool, SSNet. Diagnostic performance was evaluated in the hold-out test set and was further tested in an external cohort of 102 SSNs. Three thoracic surgeons and three radiologists were required to evaluate the invasiveness of SSNs on both test datasets to investigate the clinical utility of the proposed SSNet. Results: In the differentiation of invasive adenocarcinoma (IA), SSNet achieved a similar area under the curve [AUC; 0.914, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.813-0.987] with that of the 6 doctors (0.900, 95% CI: 0.867-0.922). When interpreting with the assistance of SSNet, the sensitivity of junior doctors, specificity of senior doctor, and their accuracy were significantly improved. In the external test, SSNet (AUC: 0.949, 95% CI: 0.884-1.000) achieved a better AUC than doctors (AUC: 0.883, 95% CI: 0.826-0.939) whose AUC increased (AUC: 0.908, 95% CI: 0.847-0.982) with SSNet assistance. In the histological subtype classifications, SSNet achieved better performance than practicing doctors. The AUCs of doctors were significantly improved with the assistance of SSNet in both 4-category and 3-category classifications to 0.836 (95% CI: 0.811-0.862) and 0.852 (95% CI: 0.825-0.882), respectively. Conclusions: The AI diagnostic system achieved non-inferior performance to doctors, and will potentially improve diagnostic performance and efficiency in SSN evaluation. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

Despite the proliferation of such projects, recent advances in applied machine learning have not yet been incorporated into or interrogated by creative AI projects, and this article also highlights opportunities for computational artists working in this area. The article concludes by envisioning how creative AI practice could include delineating the boundaries of what can and cannot be learned by extracting features from artefacts and experiences, exploring how new forms of interpretation can be encoded into neural networks, and articulating how the interaction of multiple machine learning algorithms can be used to generate new insight into the intertwining sociotechnical systems that encompass our lives. © 2020, Angus G.

The large amount of high-dimensional data generated by the existing device-free localization technology will improve the positioning accuracy as well as increase the positioning time and complexity. The positions required from single target to multi-targets become a further increasing difficulty for device-free localization. In order to satisfy the practical localizing application in smart city, an efficient multi-target device-free localization method is proposed based on a sparse coding model. To accelerate the positioning as well as improve the localization accuracy, a sparse coding-based iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm (SC-IA) is proposed and a subspace sparse coding-based iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm (SSC-IA) is presented for different practical application requirements. Experiments with practical dataset are performed for single-target and multi-targets localization, respectively. Compared with three typical machine learning algorithms: deep learning based on auto encoder, K-nearest neighbor, and orthogonal matching pursuit, experimental results show that the proposed sparse coding-based iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm and subspace sparse coding-based iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm can achieve high localization accuracy and low time cost simultaneously, so as to be more practical and applicable for the development of smart city. © The Author(s) 2019.","Device-free localization; iterative shrinkage threshold algorithm; multi-targets; smart city; sparse coding; subspace","Clustering algorithms; Deep learning; Iterative methods; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Nearest neighbor search; Shrinkage; Smart city; Device-free localizations; Multi-targets; Sparse coding; subspace; Threshold algorithms; Codes (symbols)","SAGE Publications Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Thus, we developed a machine learning (ML) assistant model, which can accurately help define the surgical area. Methods: 348 consecutive EC-I patients with the pathological diagnosis were recruited in the tertiary medical centre between January 1, 2012, and October 31, 2021. Five ML-assisted models were developed using two-step estimation methods from the candidate gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM).

Results: Our analysis identified several significant differences between the stage IA and IB groups. The top seven-candidate factors included correlation all direction offset1, correlation angle0 offset1, correlation angle45 offset1, correlation angle90 offset1, ID moment all direction offset1, ID moment angle0 offset1, and ID moment angle45 offset1. The areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of the random forest classifier (RFC) model, support vector machine (SVM), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), artificial neural network (ANN), and decision tree (DT) ranged from 0.765 to 0.877 in the training set and from 0.716 to 0.862 in the testing set, respectively.

We leveraged machine-learning techniques and advanced statistical methods to provide new insights into rupture intracranial aneurysm (RIA) risks. Methods We analysed the characteristics of 2505 patients with intracranial aneurysms (IA) discovered between 2016 and 2019. Baseline characteristics, familial history of IA, tobacco and alcohol consumption, pharmacological treatments before the IA diagnosis, cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, headaches, allergy and atopy, IA location, absolute IA size and adjusted size ratio (aSR) were analysed with a multivariable logistic regression (MLR) model. A random forest (RF) method globally assessed the risk factors and evaluated the predictive capacity of a multivariate model. Results Among 994 patients with RIA (39.7%) and 1511 patients with UIA (60.3 %), the MLR showed that IA location appeared to be the most significant factor associated with RIA (OR, 95% CI: internal carotid artery, reference; middle cerebral artery, 2.72, 2.02-3.58; anterior cerebral artery, 4.99, 3.61-6.92; posterior circulation arteries, 6.05, 4.41-8.33). Size and aSR were not significant factors associated with RIA in the MLR model and antiplatelet-treatment intake patients were less likely to have RIA (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55-0.98). IA location, age, following by aSR were the best predictors of RIA using the RF model. Conclusions The location of IA is the most consistent parameter associated with RIA. The use of â € artificial intelligence' RF helps to re-evaluate the contribution and selection of each risk factor in the multivariate model.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2021.

Our hybrid model CEEMD+CRJ+MLR is the first attempt to improve CRJ in the field of air pollution prediction and ozone forecasting. For this novel framework, CEEMD has been adopted to decompose original MDA8_O3 history into several sub-series. After that, for each IMF, CRJ is used to extract time-series features. These time-series features are fed into appropriate machine learning methods for prediction. In addition to that, residual is also predicted through normal methods. A model, which is trained with data from 1 May 2014 to 31 May 2017, is validated with data from 1 June 2017 to 30 May 2018, obtained from four stations of Beijing, China. The hybrid model has input variables which are combined with related pollutants, meteorological forecasts and UV index, and predict maximum daily 8-h average ozone (MDA8_O3) concentration in different time intervals. Our experimental results show that the CEEMD+CRJ+MLR model exhibits the best performance compared with other benchmark models generally. For four stations, IA, MAE, RMSE and MAPE average of +1 (forecasting 1 day in advance) are 0.9763, 12.84, 17.81 and 18.5% respectively and of +2 are 0.9679, 15.17, 20.15 and 23.86% respectively. Especially in the case of forecasting heavy ozone concentration (Level III), a critical issue in air pollution predictions, the classification rate of our hybrid model has improved from 29.4% (for CRJ) to 83.4% in +1 and from 38% (for CRJ) to 73% in +2. For long time forecasting, the CEEMD+CRJ+MLR also shows its outstanding performance in whole levels and level III ozone concentration. Our hybrid model, with accurate and stable results, is highly effective for MDA8_O3 concentration prediction and can efficiently be applied in other regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Deep neural networks; Machine learning; Ozone; Prediction; Recurrent neural networks","Beijing [China]; China; Air pollution; Benchmarking; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Ozone; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; ozone; Adverse health effects; Air pollution predictions; Classification rates; Concentration prediction; Machine learning methods; Ozone concentration; Surface concentration; Time series features; artificial neural network; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); machine learning; ozone; prediction; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality standard; Article; China; decomposition; forecasting; intrinsic mode function; machine learning; priority journal; recurrent neural network; support vector machine; time series analysis; Forecasting","Elsevier Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

The measurements of nine meteorological parameters were introduced as independent variables. The goal was to carefully study a limited number of initial predictors and extract stochastic information from them to build an extended set of data that allowed the creation of highly efficient predictive models. Four base models using random forest, CART ensemble and bagging, and their rotation variants, were built and evaluated. The heterogeneity of these base models was achieved by introducing five types of diversities, including a new simplified selective ensemble algorithm. The predictions from the four base models were then used as predictors in multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) models. All models were statistically tested using out-of-bag or with 5-fold and 10-fold cross-validation. In addition, a variable importance analysis was conducted. The proposed framework was used for short-term forecasting of out-of-sample data for seven days. It was shown that the stacked models outperformed all single base models. An index of agreement IA = 0.986 and a coefficient of determination of about 95% were achieved. © 2022 by the authors.

Metabolic profile changes over time may imply responses to exposures and signal development of the first IA. Our present research in The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study aimed to identify metabolome-wide signals preceding the first IA against GAD (GADA-first) or against insulin (IAA-first). We profiled metabolomes by mass spectrometry from children’s plasma at 3-month intervals after birth until appearance of the first IA. A trajectory analysis discovered each first IA preceded by reduced amino acid proline and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), respectively. With independent time point analysis following birth, we discovered dehydroascorbic acid (DHAA) contributing to the risk of each first IA, and g-aminobutyric acid (GABAs) associated with the first autoantibody against insulin (IAA-first). Methionine and alanine, compounds produced in BCAA metabolism and fatty acids, also preceded IA at different time points. Unsaturated triglycerides and phosphatidylethanolamines decreased in abundance before appearance of either autoantibody. Our findings suggest that IAA-first and GADA-first are heralded by different patterns of DHAA, GABA, multiple amino acids, and fatty acids, which may be important to primary prevention of T1D. © 2020 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Alanine; Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Autoantibodies; Child, Preschool; Dehydroascorbic Acid; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Fatty Acids; Female; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glutamate Decarboxylase; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Insulin Antibodies; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Metabolome; Methionine; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Prodromal Symptoms; Proline; Risk; Triglycerides; 2 acetylamino 2 deoxy mannopyranose; 2 oxoisocaproic acid; 2 oxoisovaleric acid; 4 aminobutyric acid; alanine; alpha tocopherol; autoantibody; branched chain amino acid; dehydroascorbic acid; diacylglycerol; glutamate decarboxylase; glycerol oleate; insulin; insulin antibody; isoleucine; lactic acid; levoglucosan; n methylalanine; palmitoleic acid; pancreas islet cell antibody; phosphatidylcholine; phosphoethanolamine; plasmalogen; proline; salicylaldehyde; sphingomyelin; sugar alcohol; tagatose; valine; xylose; autoantibody; fatty acid; methionine; phosphatidylethanolamine; triacylglycerol; amino acid metabolism; Article; case control study; child; controlled study; dietary pattern; environmental exposure; family history; genetic risk; human; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; longitudinal study; machine learning; major clinical study; mass spectrometry; metabolome; primary prevention; priority journal; seroconversion; single nucleotide polymorphism; female; genetic predisposition; immunology; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; metabolism; newborn; preschool child; prodromal symptom; risk","American Diabetes Association Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Research questions: (1) Does the actigraphy mode of operation -Proportional Integrating Measure (PIM) or Zero Crossing Mode (ZCM), responsive respectively to intensity and frequency of movements- impact sleep scoring; and (2) Can a better performing sleep scoring IA be developed by a deep learning approach combining PIM/ZCM data. Study design and Methods: ZCM and PIM plus electroencephalographic (EEG) data of 40 healthy adults (17 female, mean age: 26.7 years) were obtained from a single in-home nighttime sleep study. Effect of mode of operation was first evaluated by applying several classic deep learning models to PIM only, ZCM only, and combined ZCM/PIM data. After, a novel deep learning model was developed incorporating combined ZCM/PIM data, and its performance was compared with existing Cole-Kripke, rescored Cole-Kripke, Sadeh, and UCSD IAs. Results: Relative to the EEG reference, ZCM/PIM combined mode produced higher agreement of scoring sleep/wake epochs than only ZCM or PIM modes. The proposed novel deep learning model showed 87.7% accuracy (0.2–1% higher than the other IAs), 94.1% sensitivity (0.7–4.3% lower than the other IAs), 64.0% specificity (9.9–21.5% higher than the other IAs), and 59.9% Kappa agreement (∼6.9–11.6% higher than other IAs) in detecting sleep epochs. The proposed deep learning model did not differ significantly from the reference EEG in estimating sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), total sleep time (TST), and sleep efficiency (SE). Amount of bias and minimum detectable change in estimating SOL, WASO, TST and SE by the deep learning model was smaller than other four IAs. Interpretation: The proposed novel deep learning algorithm simultaneously incorporating ZCM/PIM mode data performs significantly better in assessing sleep than existing conventional IAs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial intelligence (AI); Convolutional neural network (CNN); Long-short-term memory (LSTM); Machine learning; Time series classification; Wrist actigraphy","actimetry; adult; article; artificial intelligence; clinical article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; female; human; human experiment; minimum detectable change; sensitivity and specificity; short term memory; sleep latency; sleep quality; sleep time; time series analysis; wrist","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Nonetheless, limited effort has been conducted to develop spatiotemporal models aiming at improving pre-positioning and deployment of fire-fighting brigades on the first dispatch. To this end, we calibrated a model to assess the probability of containment of fire by IA in Catalonia (northeastern Spain). The model was trained using machine learning algorithms from georeferenced historical fire ignition locations, fire response and weather conditions. Our results indicated that early detection, ground accessibility, and aerial support governed the broad spatial pattern of fire containment probability, with strong gradients that ranged from lowest chances of containment in northwestern mountains to highest in the coastal belt. In turn, weather conditions and fire simultaneity were crucial to explain the differences during wildfire season. We found that fires igniting above the 85th percentile of temperature and wind speed, during simultaneous fire episodes (n > 10), and 12.5 km away from the nearest fire station will probably escape IA, and grow into large events. These hazardous fire danger conditions were met 13 days per year on average during the period 1998–2015, with 5 fire simultaneous episodes escaping IA that burned 1546 ha in total. Results were provided as a set of high-resolution raster grids (100 m), which replicated the most typical weather and fire occurrence scenarios that first responders are likely to face during the wildfire season. This study reveals existing limitations in the dominant fire exclusion policy of Mediterranean areas and advocates for a comprehensive long-term wildfire management solution. Our model may help inform science-based decision-making on IA and general fire response planning in the study area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fire containment; Fire response; Fire-fighting; First dispatch; Random forest","Catalonia; Spain; Antennas; Decision making; Decision trees; Fire extinguishers; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Meteorology; Wind; Fire containment; Fire fighting; Fire response; First dispatch; Random forests; algorithm; disaster management; fire history; fire management; forest fire; machine learning; model test; policy approach; probability; spatiotemporal analysis; wildfire; adult; article; Catalonia; clinical article; decision making; female; human; male; probability; random forest; season; weather; wildfire; wind speed; Fires","Elsevier B.V.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

This complex phenomenon raises continuous interests in both science and industry for understanding the structure-activity dynamics under electrochemical conditions. Here we report the first theoretical attempt, by combining the machine-learning-based global optimization (SSW-NN method) and modified Poisson-Boltzmann continuum solvation (CM-MPB) based on first-principles calculations, to elucidate the potential-dependent structure evolution on a stepped Pt surface and its catalytic activity, in which the cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves are simulated to compare with experiment. We selected four types of structure domains on Pt(110), namely, Type-Ia: ordered Pt(110)-(1 × 1); Type-Ib: disordering of Pt(110)-(1 × 1); Type-II: ordered Pt(110)-(1 × 2) (the missing-row reconstruction); and Type-III: reconstructed Pt(110)-(1 × 4), and reveal the potential dependence of the coverage of H atom adsorbate, the total passed charge, and the CV of these Pt(110) surface domains. In particular, the surface reconstruction from Type-Ia to -Ib occurs at +0.20 V vs NHE when the average H coverage is above 0.60 ML, which produces the key five-coordinated Pt (Pt5c) sites.

We herein analyze and verify the machine learning based estimations for the growth performance in swine which includes the daily gain of body weight (DG), feed intake (FI), required growth period for growing/finishing phase (GP), and marketed-pigs per sow per year (MSY), based on the farm specific data and climate, i.e., temperature, humidity, initial age (IA), initial body weight (IBW), number of pigs (NU) and stocking density (SD). The growth data used in our work is collected from 55 pig farms which are located across South Korea for the period between October 2017 and September 2018. In the estimation of growth performance, four machine learning schemes are applied, which are the logistic regression, linear support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and random forest. Through the evaluation, we confirm that the accuracy of estimation for growth performance can be improved by 28% using machine learning techniques compared to the base line performance which is obtained by the ZeroR classifier. We also find that the accuracy of estimation is heavily dependent on the pre-process of growth data. © 2013 IEEE.","Daily gain; estimation; growth performance; Internet of Things; machine learning","Anthropometry; Decision trees; Estimation; Internet of things; Learning systems; Mammals; Support vector machines; Base-line performance; Daily gain; Growth performance; High productivity; Linear Support Vector Machines; Logistic regressions; Machine learning techniques; Stocking density; Machine learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

GBS serotyping is an essential means for the investigation of possible infection outbreaks and can identify possible sources of infection. Although it is possible to determine GBS serotypes by either immuno-serotyping or geno-serotyping, both traditional methods are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In recent years, the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been reported as an effective tool for the determination of GBS serotypes in a more rapid and accurate manner. Thus, this work aims to investigate GBS serotypes by incorporating machine learning techniques with MALDI-TOF MS to carry out the identification. Results: In this study, a total of 787 GBS isolates, obtained from three research and teaching hospitals, were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, and the serotype of the GBS was determined by a geno-serotyping experiment. The peaks of mass-to-charge ratios were regarded as the attributes to characterize the various serotypes of GBS. Machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), were then used to construct predictive models for the five different serotypes (Types Ia, Ib, III, V, and VI). After optimization of feature selection and model generation based on training datasets, the accuracies of the selected models attained 54.9-87.1% for various serotypes based on independent testing data. Specifically, for the major serotypes, namely type III and type VI, the accuracies were 73.9 and 70.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed models have been adopted to implement a web-based tool (GBSTyper), which is now freely accessible at http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/GBSTyper/, for providing efficient and effective detection of GBS serotypes based on a MALDI-TOF MS spectrum. Overall, this work has demonstrated that the combination of MALDI-TOF MS and machine intelligence could provide a practical means of clinical pathogen testing. © 2019 The Author(s).","GBS; Group B streptococcus; Machine learning; MALDI-TOF-MS; Serotypes","Machine Learning; Serotyping; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Streptococcus; Decision trees; Desorption; Drug products; Hospitals; Inductively coupled plasma; Ionization; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mass spectrometry; Support vector machines; Group B Streptococcus; Machine intelligence; Machine learning techniques; MALDI TOF MS; Mass-to-charge ratio; Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass; Serotypes; Training data sets; classification; machine learning; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; serotyping; Streptococcus; Machine learning","BioMed Central Ltd.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

This study aimed to reveal specific, sensitive, and non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis and classification of ruptured and unruptured IA, to benefit the development of novel treatment strategies and therapeutics altering the course of the disease. We first assembled an extensive candidate biomarker bank of IA, comprising up to 717 proteins, based on altered proteins discovered in the current tissue and serum proteomic analysis, as well as from previous studies. Mass spectrometry assays for hundreds of biomarkers were efficiently designed using our proposed deep learning-based method, termed DeepPRM. A total of 113 potential markers were further quantitated in serum cohort I (n = 212) & II (n = 32). Combined with a machine-learning-based pipeline, we built two sets of biomarker combinations (P6 & P8) to accurately distinguish IA from healthy controls (accuracy: 87.50%) or classify IA rupture patients (accuracy: 91.67%) upon evaluation in the external validation set (n = 32).

These TCGA blood signatures remained predictive when applied to patients with stage Ia–IIc cancer and cancers lacking any genomic alterations currently measured on two commercial-grade cell-free tumour DNA platforms, despite the use of very stringent decontamination analyses that discarded up to 92.3% of total sequence data. In addition, we could discriminate among samples from healthy, cancer-free individuals (n = 69) and those from patients with multiple types of cancer (prostate, lung, and melanoma; 100 samples in total) solely using plasma-derived, cell-free microbial nucleic acids.

The aim of this study was to develop a predictive occlusion score based on pretreatment clinical and angiographic criteria. Methods Consecutive patients with ≥6 months follow-up were included from 2008 to 2019 and retrospectively analyzed. Each IA was evaluated using the Raymond-Roy occlusion classification (RROC) and dichotomized as occluded (A) or residual (B/C); 80% of patients were randomly assigned to the training sample. Feature selection and binary outcome prediction relied on logistic regression and threshold maximizing class separation selected by a CART tree algorithm. The feature selection was addressed by a genetic algorithm selected from the 30 pretreatment available variables. Results The study included 146 patients with 154 IAs. Feature selection yielded a combination of six variables with a good cross-validated accuracy on the test sample, a combination we labeled DIANES score (IA diameter, indication, parent artery diameter ratio, neck ratio, side-branch artery, and sex). A score of more than -6 maximized the ability to predict RROC=A with sensitivity of 87% (95% CI 79% to 95%) and specificity of 82% (95% CI 64% to 96%) in the training sample. Accuracy was 86% (95% CI 79% to 94%). In the test sample, sensitivity and specificity were 89% (95% CI 77% to 98%) and 60% (95% CI 33% to 86%), respectively. Accuracy was 81% (95% CI 69% to 91%).

In this research, specific conductance (SC) of groundwater is predicted based on different individual and integrative machine learning, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and nonlinear mathematical models. For developing the integrative models, the well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO) and novel manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) heuristic algorithms are embedded in the models. Presenting different univariate, bivariate, and multivariate input scenarios, the parameters used to develop and validate the models include groundwater level, salinity, and water temperature at an observation well near Florida City. The findings reveal that applying more independent parameters (multivariate scenario) enhances the performance of both the mathematical and machine learning models. Even though the mathematical models present an acceptable performance for the prediction of SC (index of agreement, IA, equals 0.933), the ANFIS models provide the most accurate SC predictions (IA = 0.943).

A high index of clinical suspicion is needed as imaging is not routinely used during hospital admission. This study aimed to identify clinical predictors of an IA among hospitalized patients with CD using machine learning. Methods: We created an electronic data repository of all patients with CD who visited the emergency department of our tertiary medical center between 2012 and 2018. We searched for the presence of an IA on abdominal imaging within 7 days from visit. Machine learning models were trained to predict the presence of an IA. A logistic regression model was compared with a random forest model. Results: Overall, 309 patients with CD were hospitalized and underwent abdominal imaging within 7 days. Forty patients (12.9%) were diagnosed with an IA. On multivariate analysis, high C-reactive protein (CRP) [above 65 mg/l, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 16 (95% CI: 5.51–46.18)], leukocytosis [above 10.5 K/μl, aOR: 4.47 (95% CI: 1.91–10.45)], thrombocytosis [above 322.5 K/μl, aOR: 4.1 (95% CI: 2–8.73)], and tachycardia [over 97 beats per minute, aOR: 2.7 (95% CI: 1.37–5.3)] were independently associated with an IA. Random forest model showed an area under the curve of 0.817 ± 0.065 with six features (CRP, hemoglobin, WBC, age, current biologic therapy, and BUN). Conclusion: In our large tertiary center cohort, the machine learning model identified the association of six clinical features (CRP, hemoglobin, WBC, age, BUN, and biologic therapy) with the presentation of an IA. These may assist as a decision support tool in triaging CD patients for imaging to exclude this potentially life-threatening complication. © The Author(s), 2021.","abscess; Crohn complications; machine learning","albumin; aminosalicylic acid; C reactive protein; creatinine; hemoglobin; immunomodulating agent; lactate dehydrogenase; sodium; steroid; urea; abdomen; abdominal pain; accuracy; adult; area under the curve; Article; biological therapy; blood pressure; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical feature; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; Crohn disease; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test accuracy study; diarrhea; dyslipidemia; female; fever; hospital patient; human; hypertension; hypothyroidism; imaging; inflammatory bowel disease; intra abdominal abscesses; laboratory test; leukocyte; leukocytosis; machine learning; magnetic resonance elastography; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; nomogram; predictive value; pulse rate; pus; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; recursive feature elimination; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; systolic blood pressure; tachycardia; thrombocyte; thrombocytosis; urea nitrogen blood level; vomiting","SAGE Publications Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Here we show that deep methylation sequencing aided by a machine-learning classifier of methylation patterns enables the detection of tumour-derived signals at dilution factors as low as 1 in 10,000. For a total of 308 patients with surgery-resectable lung cancer and 261 age- and sex-matched non-cancer control individuals recruited from two hospitals, the assay detected 52–81% of the patients at disease stages IA to III with a specificity of 96% (95% confidence interval (CI) 93–98%). In a subgroup of 115 individuals, the assay identified, at 100% specificity (95% CI 91–100%), nearly twice as many patients with cancer as those identified by ultradeep mutation sequencing analysis. The low amounts of ctDNA permitted by machine-learning-aided deep methylation sequencing could provide advantages in cancer screening and the assessment of treatment efficacy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","","Adult; Biomarkers, Tumor; Case-Control Studies; Circulating Tumor DNA; DNA Methylation; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Alkylation; Deep learning; Disease control; Diseases; Gene encoding; Learning systems; Methylation; Pattern recognition; Tumors; Turing machines; circulating tumor DNA; DNA nucleotidylexotransferase; single stranded DNA; circulating tumor DNA; tumor marker; Cancer control; Cancer screening; Confidence interval; Dilution factors; Plasma samples; Sequencing analysis; Ultra deeps; Ultrasensitive detection; adult; Article; cancer patient; cancer screening; cancer size; cancer staging; case control study; classifier; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; DNA fingerprinting; DNA methylation; DNA sequencing; droplet digital polymerase chain reaction; early cancer; early cancer diagnosis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Escherichia coli; false negative result; female; gene amplification; high throughput sequencing; human; human genome; human tissue; in vitro study; incidence; lung cancer; machine learning; major clinical study; male; methylome; pattern recognition; predictive value; proof of concept; quantitative methylation specific polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity; somatic mutation; tumor biopsy; blood; clinical trial; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; early cancer diagnosis; genetics; lung tumor; middle aged; multicenter study; pathology; procedures; Diagnosis","Nature Research","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

With its rapid spread, since the beginning of the outbreak in December 2019, the disease transmitted by SARS-CoV-2 has already caused over 2 million deaths to date. In this work, we propose a web solution, called Heg.IA, to optimize the diagnosis of Covid-19 through the use of artificial intelligence. Our system aims to support decision-making regarding to diagnosis of Covid-19 and to the indication of hospitalization on regular ward, semi-ICU or ICU based on decision a Random Forest architecture with 90 trees. The main idea is that healthcare professionals can insert 41 hematological parameters from common blood tests and arterial gasometry into the system. Then, Heg.IA will provide a diagnostic report. The system reached good results for both Covid-19 diagnosis and to recommend hospitalization. For the first scenario we found average results of accuracy of 92.891%±0.851, kappa index of 0.858 ± 0.017, sensitivity of 0.936 ± 0.011, precision of 0.923 ± 0.011, specificity of 0.921 ± 0.012 and area under ROC of 0.984 ± 0.003. As for the indication of hospitalization, we achieved excellent performance of accuracies above 99% and more than 0.99 for the other metrics in all situations. By using a computationally simple method, based on the classical decision trees, we were able to achieve high diagnosis performance. Heg.IA system may be a way to overcome the testing unavailability in the context of Covid-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We studied 67 children: 42 who developed IA (20 of 42 progressed to diabetes) and 25 control subjects matched for sex and age. Biomarkers were assessed at four time points: Earliest available sample, just prior to IA, just after IA, and just prior to diabetes onset. Predictors of IA and progression to diabetes were identified across disparate sources using an integrative machine learning algorithm and optimization-based feature selection. Our integrative approach was predictive of IA (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.91) and progression to diabetes (AUC 0.92) based on standard cross-validation (CV). Among the strongest predictors of IA were change in serum ascorbate, 3-methyl-oxobutyrate, and the PTPN22 (rs2476601) polymorphism. Serum glucose, ADP fibrinogen, and mannose were among the strongest predictors of progression to diabetes. This proof-of-principle analysis is the first study to integrate large, diverse biomarker data sets into a limited number of features, highlighting differences in pathways leading to IA from those predicting progression to diabetes. Integratedmodels, if validated in independent populations, could provide novel clues concerning the pathways leading to IA and type 1 diabetes. © 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","","Adenosine Diphosphate; Adolescent; Ascorbic Acid; Autoimmunity; Biomarkers; Butyrates; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Fibrinogen; Humans; Infant; Male; Mannose; Models, Biological; Polymorphism, Genetic; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 22; Young Adult; 3 methyl oxobutyrate; adenosine diphosphate; ascorbic acid; biological marker; fibrinogen; glucose; mannose; oxoacid; unclassified drug; adenosine diphosphate; ascorbic acid; biological marker; butyric acid derivative; fibrinogen; mannose; non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase 22; PTPN22 protein, human; adolescent; adult; area under the curve; Article; autoimmunity; case control study; child; clinical article; controlled study; disease exacerbation; feature selection; female; genotype; glucose blood level; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; machine learning; male; metabolomics; outcome assessment; pancreas islet autoimmunity; priority journal; proteomics; receiver operating characteristic; autoimmunity; biological model; blood; genetic polymorphism; genetics; immunology; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; metabolism; preschool child; young adult","American Diabetes Association Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Specific neuroimaging biomarkers are urgently needed for IA diagnosis and the evaluation of therapy efficacy. Therefore, this study aimed to develop support vector machine (SVM) models to identify IA and assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) based on unbiased functional connectivity density (FCD). Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 27 individuals with IA before and after 8-week CBT sessions and 30 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs). The discriminative FCDs were computed as the features of the support vector classification (SVC) model to identify individuals with IA from HCs, and the changes in these discriminative FCDs after treatment were further used as features of the support vector regression (SVR) model to evaluate the efficacy of CBT. Based on the informative FCDs, our SVC model successfully differentiated individuals with IA from HCs with an accuracy of 82.5% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Our SVR model successfully evaluated the efficacy of CBT using the FCD change ratio with a correlation efficient of 0.59. The brain regions contributing to IA classification and CBT efficacy assessment were the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), middle frontal cortex (MFC) and angular gyrus (AG), the right premotor cortex (PMC) and middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and the bilateral cerebellum, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and superior frontal cortex (SFC). These findings confirmed the FCDs of hyperactive impulsive habit system, hypoactive reflecting system and sensitive interoceptive reward awareness system as potential neuroimaging biomarkers for IA, which might provide objective indexes for the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of IA. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Qin, Li, Yao, Sun, Gong, Dai, Wen, Zhang, Zhang, Luo and Zhu.","biomarker; cognitive behavior therapy; internet addiction; support vector classification; support vector regression","biological marker; accuracy; adult; angular gyrus; Article; awareness; cingulate gyrus; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; education; feature selection; female; frontal cortex; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; internet addiction; machine learning; major clinical study; male; medial frontal cortex; motivation; neuroimaging; orbital cortex; premotor cortex; questionnaire; receiver operating characteristic; resting state network; Self-rating Anxiety Scale; Self-rating Depression Scale; support vector machine; treatment response","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Particulate Matter less than 2.5 µm in diameter (PM2.5) is the most dangerous air pollutant invading the human respiratory system and causing lung and heart diseases. Therefore, innovative air pollution forecasting methods and systems are required to reduce such risk. To that end, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled system for monitoring and predicting PM2.5 concentration on both edge devices and the cloud. This system employs a hybrid prediction architecture using several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms hosted by Nonlinear AutoRegression with eXogenous input (NARX). It uses the past 24 h of PM2.5, cumulated wind speed and cumulated rain hours to predict the next hour of PM2.5. This system was tested on a PC to evaluate cloud prediction and a Raspberry Pi to evaluate edge devices’ prediction. Such a system is essential, responding quickly to air pollution in remote areas with low bandwidth or no internet connection. The performance of our system was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), Index of Agreement (IA), and duration in seconds. The obtained results highlighted that NARX/LSTM achieved the highest R2 and IA and the least RMSE and NRMSE, outperforming other previously proposed deep learning hybrid algorithms. In contrast, NARX/XGBRF achieved the best balance between accuracy and speed on the Raspberry Pi. © 2021, The Author(s).","Air pollution forecast; Edge computing; IoT; Machine learning; NARX architecture; PM<sub>2.5</sub>","","Springer International Publishing","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

DeepIA reduces the beam sweep time compared to a conventional exhaustive search-based IA process by utilizing only a subset of the available beams. DeepIA maps received signal strengths (RSSs) obtained from a subset of beams to the beam that is best oriented to the receiver. In both line of sight (LoS) and non-line of sight (NLoS) conditions, DeepIA reduces the IA time and outperforms the conventional IA&#x0027;s beam prediction accuracy. We show that DeepIA&#x0027;s accuracy saturates with the number of beams used, and also depends on the particular choice of the beams used. The choice of beams that are selected is consequential and improves accuracy by upto upto <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$35\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$70\%$</tex-math></inline-formula> in NLoS and LoS channels.

L'analyse de ces innovations et l’étude de leurs caractéristiques à l'origine de leur validation réglementaire renseignent sur les perspectives de recherche et de développements de l'IA dans notre spécialité. L'apport de l'IA pourrait être réparti en 3 catégories: l'assistance (IA-A), la substitution (IA-S) ou l'extension (IA-X) de l'expertise médicale humaine. Les freins à son émancipation seraient réduits d'autant que l'intégralité de ses 3 champs d'usage serait considérée sans se réduire à la seule IA-S, source du fantasme d'une intelligence concurrente de celle de l'homme. Dès lors, des évolutions du contexte réglementaire d’évaluation et de validation en matière d'innovation en IA seraient alors nécessaires pour en permettre l'essor dans nos pratiques et en autoriser la commercialisation sur notre marché, voire le remboursement selon certains usages. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Algorithm; Artificial intelligence; Cancer de prostate; Deep learning; Deep learning algorithme; Intelligence artificielle; IRM prostate; Machine learning; Machine learning; Prostate cancer; Prostate MRI","Article; artificial intelligence; clinical practice; deep learning; human; machine learning; medical research; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; urology","Elsevier Masson SAS","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Patients and methods: Data were collected from NCDB from years 2010–2014. Based on demographic and surgical characteristics, a clinical score was developed using the random survival forest machine learning algorithm. Results: Of 1,751 patients with stage IA UPSC, 1,012 (58%) received chemotherapy and 739 (42%) did not. Older age (HR 1.06), comorbidities (HR 1.31), larger tumor size (HR 1.27), lymphovascular invasion (HR 1.86), positive peritoneal cytology (HR 2.62), no pelvic lymph node dissection (HR 1.51), and no chemotherapy (HR 2.16) were associated with poorer prognosis. Compared to no chemotherapy, patients who underwent chemotherapy had a 5-year overall survival of 80% vs. 67%. To better delineate those who may derive more benefit from chemotherapy, we designed a clinical calculator capable of dividing patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups with associated 5-year OS of 86%, 73%, and 53%, respectively. Using the calculator to assess the relative benefit of chemotherapy in each risk group, chemotherapy improved the 5-year OS in the high (42% to 64%; p < 0.001) and moderate risk group (66% to 79%; p < 0.001) but did not benefit the low risk group (84% to 87%; p = 0.29). Conclusion: Our results suggest a clinical calculator is useful for counseling and personalizing chemotherapy for stage IA UPSC. © 2019","Chemotherapy; Machine learning; Personalized medicine; Uterine papillary serous","Aged; Algorithms; Cystadenocarcinoma, Papillary; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous; Female; Humans; Machine Learning; Neoplasm Staging; Nomograms; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Reproducibility of Results; Uterine Neoplasms; adult; aged; Article; ascites fluid cytology; brachytherapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer prognosis; cancer size; cancer staging; comorbidity; controlled study; endometrium carcinoma; external beam radiotherapy; female; high risk population; human; hysterectomy; low risk population; lymph node dissection; lymph vessel metastasis; machine learning; major clinical study; omentectomy; overall survival; paraaortic lymph node; pelvis lymph node; personalized medicine; priority journal; radical hysterectomy; algorithm; cystadenocarcinoma; machine learning; nomogram; pathology; predictive value; prognosis; proportional hazards model; reproducibility; uterus cancer","Academic Press Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

It is a secure and centralized cloud platform containing a set of management tools for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. It employs artificial intelligence to perform in-depth analysis via text-mining techniques in order to extract both dynamic and static data from work injury case files. When it is fully developed, this system can provide a more accurate prediction model for cost of work injuries. It can also predict return-to-work (RTW) trajectory and provide advice on medical care and RTW interventions to all RTW stakeholders. The project will comprise three stages. Stage one: to identify human factors in terms of both facilitators and barriers RTW through face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions with different RTW stakeholders in order to collect opinions related to facilitators, barriers, and essential interventions for RTW of injured workers; Stage two: to develop a machine learning model which employs artificial intelligence to perform in-depth analysis. The technologies used will include: 1. Text-mining techniques including English and Chinese work segmentation as well as N-Gram to extract both dynamic and static data from free-style text as well as sociodemographic information from work injury case files; 2. Principle component/independent component analysis to identify features of significant relationships with RTW outcomes or combine raw features into new features; 3. A machine learning model that combines Variational Autoencoder, Long and Short Term Memory, and Neural Turning Machines. Stage two will also include the development of an interactive dashboard and website to query the trained machine learning model. Stage three: to field test the SWIM system. Conclusion: SWIM ia secure and centralized cloud platform containing a set of management tools for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning.

Clostridium novyi sensu lato contains a large mobilome consisting of plasmids and circular bacteriophages. Here, we explored clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) arrays and their associated proteins (Cas) to shed light on the link between evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems and the plasmid and phage composition in a study of 58 Clostridium novyi sensu lato genomes. In 55 of these genomes, types I-B (complete or partial), I-D, II-C, III-B, III-D, or V-U CRISPR-Cas systems were detected in chromosomes as well as in mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Type I-B predominated (67.2%) and was the only CRISPR type detected in the Ia, III, and IV genomic lineages. Putative type V-U CRISPR Cas14a genes were detected in two different cases: next to partial type-IB CRISPR loci on the phage encoding the botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) in lineage Ia and in 12 lineage II genomes, as part of a putative integrative element related to a phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI). In the putative PICI, Cas14a was associated with CRISPR arrays and restriction modification (RM) systems as part of an accessory locus. This is the first time a PICI containing such locus has been detected in C. botulinum. Mobilome composition and dynamics were also investigated based on the contents of the CRISPR arrays and the study of spacers. A large proportion of identified protospacers (20.2%) originated from Clostridium novyi sensu lato (p1_Cst, p4_BKT015925, p6_Cst, CWou-2020a, p1_BKT015925, and p2_BKT015925), confirming active exchanges within this genospecies and the key importance of specific MGEs in Clostridium novyi sensu lato. © Copyright © 2021 Le Gratiet, Le Marechal, Devaere, Chemaly and Woudstra.","Cas14a; Clostridium botulinum group III; CRISPR-Cas; mobilome; phage-inducible chromosomal island; protospacers; type V-U CRISPR","botulinum toxin; RNA 16S; Acinetobacter; Article; Bacillus; bacteriophage; bacterium; bacterium identification; bioinformatics; Borrelia; Clostridium; Clostridium botulinum; Clostridium hemolyticum; Clostridium novyi; Clostridium novyi sensu lato; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; CRISPR Cas system; DNA sequence; Escherichia; gene function; Herelleviridae; Lactococcus; machine learning; microbial diversity; microbial population dynamics; mobile genetic element; nonhuman; phylogeny; plasmid; sequence alignment; simple sequence repeat; Siphoviridae; Staphylococcaceae; Streptococcus","Frontiers Media S.A.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Therapeutic intervention targeting the PI3K pathway has achieved limited success due to the intricate balance of its different components and isoforms. Here, we systematically investigated the genomic and transcriptomic signatures associated with response to KIN-193, a compound specifically targeting the p110β isoform. By integrating genomic, transcriptomic, and drug response profiles from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we identified mutational and transcriptomic signatures associated with KIN-193 and further created statistical models to predict the treatment effect of KIN-193 in cell lines, which may eventually be clinically valuable.

To this end, a database was compiled from the available literature, composed of 11 input variables. The input variables for predicting tensile strength of nanocomposites were selected for the following main reasons: (i) type of polymer matrix, (ii) mechanical properties of polymer matrix, (iii) physical characteristics of CNTs, (iv) mechanical properties of CNTs and (v) incorporation parameters such as CNT weight fraction, CNT surface modification method and processing method. As the problem of prediction is highly dimensional (with 11 dimensions), the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was selected and optimized by means of a parametric study. The correlation coefficient (R), Willmott’s index of agreement (IA), slope of regression, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were employed as error measurement criteria when training the GPR model. The GPR model exhibited good performance for both training and testing parts (RMSE = 5.982 and 5.327 MPa, MAE = 3.447 and 3.539 MPa, respectively). In addition, uncertainty analysis was also applied to estimate the prediction confidence intervals. Finally, the prediction capability of the GPR model with different ranges of values of input variables was investigated and discussed. For practical application, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) was developed in Matlab for predicting the tensile strength of nanocomposites. © The Author(s) 2020.","Carbon nanotubes; Gaussian process regression; machine learning; nanocomposites; tensile strength","Errors; Forecasting; Graphical user interfaces; Machine learning; Mean square error; Nanocomposites; Polymer matrix composites; Predictive analytics; Tensile strength; Uncertainty analysis; Gaussian process regression; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Mean absolute percentage error; Mechanical properties of polymers; Physical characteristics; Polymer carbon nanotubes; Root mean squared errors; Surface modification methods; Carbon nanotubes","SAGE Publications Ltd","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

We developed multiple ML models for IA stability assessment and compare their performances. We enrolled 1897 consecutive patients with unstable (n = 528) and stable (n = 1539) IAs. Thirteen patient-specific clinical features and eighteen aneurysm morphological features were extracted to generate support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) models. The discriminatory performances of the models were compared with statistical logistic regression (LR) model and the PHASES score in IA stability assessment. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) values for each model in the test set, the AUC values for RF, SVM, and ANN were 0.850 (95% CI 0.806–0.893), 0.858 (95 %CI 0.816–0.900), and 0.867 (95% CI 0.828–0.906), demonstrating good discriminatory ability. All ML models exhibited superior performance compared with the statistical LR and the PHASES score (the AUC values were 0.830 and 0.589, respectively; RF versus PHASES, P < 0.001; RF versus LR, P = 0.038). Important features contributing to the stability discrimination included three clinical features (location, sidewall/bifurcation type, and presence of symptoms) and three morphological features (undulation index, height-width ratio, and irregularity). These findings demonstrate the potential of ML to augment the clinical decision-making process for IA stability assessment, which may enable more optimal management for patients with IAs in the future. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Artificial intelligence; Intracranial aneurysms; Machine learning; Risk evaluation; Unstable aneurysm","Adult; Aged; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intracranial Aneurysm; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; adult; aneurysm volume; anterior cerebral artery; anterior communicating artery; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; brain circulation; clinical decision making; clinical feature; diabetes mellitus; family history; feed forward neural network; female; follow up; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; internal carotid artery; intracranial aneurysm; ischemic heart disease; linear support vector machine; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; middle cerebral artery; morphology; posterior communicating artery; priority journal; risk assessment; smoking; support vector machine; unruptured intracranial aneurysm; aged; diagnostic imaging; intracranial aneurysm; pathophysiology; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study","Springer","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

The global trend of asset management follows risk management that accounts for the probability and consequences of failures. Because asset management systems tend to be composed of various legacy systems, each of which is installed and designed to collect data according to a certain data type and acquisition purpose, it is necessary to develop a system that cleans and integrates data acquired from each legacy system. This study explores the development of an asset management system for a transmission system as a representative linear asset consisting of different segments in a sequence. First, the configurations and characteristics of linear asset datasets are analyzed. Second, an automatic data cleaning system, equipped with six types of data cleaning functions for extracting dirty data from entire datasets, is proposed. An algorithm for data imputation, which is essential for estimating the remaining useful life, is developed based on principal component analysis-iterative algorithm (PCA-IA). Afterward, the performance of the proposed system is verified using actual data with the help of the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO). Specifically, to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, an automatic cleaning process is demonstrated using actual legacy datasets.  © 2013 IEEE.","data cleaning; data imputation; database management; linear asset; machine learning; principal component analysis; Transmission system","Asset management; Electric industry; Electric power transmission; Information management; Investments; Iterative methods; Learning systems; Legacy systems; Maintainability; Principal component analysis; Risk management; Telecommunication cables; Assets management; Cleaning; Data cleaning; Data imputation; Database management; Linear asset; Machine-learning; Oil-filled cables; Power; Power system; Principal-component analysis; Transmission systems; Oil filled cables","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","English","Article","Final","Scopus"

Our goal was to evaluate the addition of marginal features to a baseline radiomics model on computed tomography (CT) images to predict the degree of pathologic invasiveness. Methods: We identified 236 patients from two cohorts (training, n = 189; validation, n = 47) who underwent surgery for GGNs. All GGNs were pathologically confirmed as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), or invasive adenocarcinoma (IA). The regions of interest were semi-automatically annotated and 40 radiomics features were computed. We selected features using L1-norm regularization to build the baseline radiomics model. Additional marginal features were developed using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of intratumoral intensities. An improved model was built combining the baseline model with CDF features. Three classifiers were tested for both models. Results: The baseline radiomics model included five features and resulted in an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8419 (training) and 0.9142 (validation) for the three classifiers. The second model, with the additional marginal features, resulted in AUCs of 0.8560 (training) and 0.9581 (validation). All three classifiers performed better with the added features. The support vector machine showed the most performance improvement (AUC improvement = 0.0790) and the best performance was achieved by the logistic classifier (validation AUC = 0.9825). Conclusion: Our novel marginal features, when combined with a baseline radiomics model, can help differentiate IA from AIS and MIA on preoperative CT scans. Key Points: • Our novel marginal features could improve the existing radiomics model to predict the degree of pathologic invasiveness in lung adenocarcinoma. © 2020, European Society of Radiology.","Classification; Lung adenocarcinoma; Machine learning; Quantitative evaluation; Tumor microenvironment","Adenocarcinoma in Situ; Adenocarcinoma of Lung; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Area Under Curve; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Margins of Excision; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Retrospective Studies; Support Vector Machine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; biological marker; adenocarcinoma in situ; adult; aged; Article; cancer size; cancer staging; classifier; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; histogram; histopathology; human; lung adenocarcinoma; lung nodule; machine learning; major clinical study; male; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; radiomics; retrospective study; support vector machine; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment; x-ray computed tomography; adenocarcinoma in situ; area under the curve; diagnostic imaging; lung adenocarcinoma; lung tumor; middle aged; pathology; procedures; surgical margin; tumor invasion; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography","Springer","English","Article","Final","Scopus"
